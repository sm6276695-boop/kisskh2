00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.280
What's wrong?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.560
I dreamed about our child.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.230
But he disappeared in an instant.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.640
It's been so long.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.920
Try not to think about it.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.150
Didn't you say you were fine?

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:55.640
I was fine at the time.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.110
But now I'm not.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.840
You know how much I was looking forward to this dance performance.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.920
It's not like you didn't know.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.950
Didn't I ask you when I booked the tickets?

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.270
And now you're treating me like this.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.800
Do you think I want this?

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.040
Do you think I want to go out socializing every day?

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.390
Do you think I don't want to come home every day?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.990
Who am I doing this for?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.320
Isn't it all for you?

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.710
I don't want you to go back to

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.950
the life you had before we got married.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:18.230
Lu Ming.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.040
Back then, even though we squeezed into

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.760
that shabby, old rental apartment,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.760
and ate simple meals every day,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.950
I was happy.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.670
But I wasn't happy.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:30.480
I did it for us.

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.880
I wanted you to have this kind of life.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.040
I wanted you to buy things without worrying about the price.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.950
I wanted you to stand tall in front of your mother.

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:37.880
What did I do wrong?

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.880
Lu Ming.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.950
This kind of life—

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.360
I can't go on like this.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.640
Let's separate.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.480
I won't separate from you.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:14.550
Do you know?

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.870
Xu Xin,

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:18.750
ever since the first time

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.870
I met your Lu,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.040
I could tell right away.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.870
He’s my golden goose.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.110
Do you know how I see him?

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.520
He’s the modern Da Vinci,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.110
Raphael,

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.230
Michelangelo,

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:34.160
Van Gogh.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:37.040
Everyone,

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:39.230
Wherever I go, I always say one thing:

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.520
Without Mr. Ma,

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:42.670
I wouldn’t be where I am today.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.160
That’s a bit heartless, isn’t it?

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.840
No need for words between brothers.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.800
It’s all in the drink.

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.550
You’re finally speaking up.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:52.430
At last, you’re talking.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:53.920
If you can talk, say more.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.400
Come on.

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.230
Sit down.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.480
Lu,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.670
do you remember the first time

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:59.920
we met?

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.750
What did you say about me?

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.400
If Van Gogh had met me,

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.040
his sunflowers

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.750
would have turned into money trees.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.430
Look,

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.360
your wife’s haute couture,

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.630
and your outfit,

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.720
don’t you think this money tree is pretty good?

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.920
Mr. Ma,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.520
if you put it that way,

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.190
I have to drink as a penalty.

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.920
Cheers to you.

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.110
Alright.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.160
These idiots

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.520
don’t know anything.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.400
Who are they pretending to be?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.430
But at least they’ve helped us before.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.480
Do you really think they’re helping us?

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:48.160
In their eyes,

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400
I’m just a tool.

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400
Used and thrown away.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.400
They keep flaunting my work and cheating people.

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:55.480
Talking nonsense all the time.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.630
Mr. Zhu,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:56.990
Mr. Liu,

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.400
Mr. Yang,

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:57.960
Mr. Ma—

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.480
Everything I have today

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.840
is earned by my own ability.

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:01.870
I don’t need anyone’s help.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.840
You’re drunk.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.750
I’m not drunk.

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.920
Let me tell you,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:12.160
this life is driving me crazy.

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:15.310
Then why do you keep doing this?

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.550
For us.

00:06:20.430 --> 00:06:21.360
For you.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:37.190
Ms. Xu,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:38.920
Ms. Xu,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.960
Ms. Xu,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.400
This is as you requested,

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.230
the drafted divorce agreement.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.520
Thank you.

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.550
Let me confirm with you,

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.520
are you sure you want to give up all assets?

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:56.840
According to the law,

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.280
you’re entitled to half

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.480
of the marital assets.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:03.310
I’m sure.

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:05.840
Ms. Xu,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.550
that’s a significant amount.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:10.600
Your husband is now a famous artist.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.430
He owns a lot of assets.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.480
Are you sure you want to give it all up?

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.960
This is enough.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.480
He earned the money.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.280
Let him keep it.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:24.600
Alright, Ms. Xu.

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:26.160
This agreement

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.160
will take effect once you and your husband sign it.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.160
It will then be valid.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.360
Luckily, you two have no children.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:32.920
That makes things much simpler.

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:35.480
Yes.

00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:01.600
Are you joking with me?

00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:02.870
Lu Ming,

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.720
We can’t go on anymore.

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:08.520
Let’s separate.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:16.480
Everyone knows we're a loving couple.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.550
An idealized pair.

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:19.750
You're bringing up divorce now?

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.040
Did something happen?

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.240
An idealized pair.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.670
A loving couple.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:33.880
Have you lost track

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.070
of what's real

00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:36.950
and what's just your public persona?

00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.920
Let's separate.

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.160
I can't watch you like this anymore.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.670
You keep torturing yourself.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.400
I married you despite so much pressure back then.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.670
Your mother humiliated me in front of everyone.

00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:53.640
I stayed because I loved you and didn't want to leave.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.070
I endured everything, you know?

00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.710
Is it possible we were wrong from the start?

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.710
Now you want to

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:25.280
deny everything that happened before?

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.000
Do you remember

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.430
back in our elective class

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.830
the novel we discussed?

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:33.710
Xu Xin.

00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:35.240
Everything I've done

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.240
was just to give us a better life.

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.350
I just wanted to chase our dreams.

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:40.670
Shouldn't you support me?

00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:41.800
Support you?

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:51.190
Haven't I supported you?

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:55.190
I've always supported you.

00:09:55.190 --> 00:09:56.550
I had to work hard

00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:57.830
and earn money

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.400
to give us a better life.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.310
Do you understand?

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.120
Lu Ming.

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.120
I've never looked down on you for being poor

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.470
or for not making enough money.

00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.710
On the contrary,

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:09.710
all our problems now

00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:11.550
are because we have money.

00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.470
I want you to follow your own dreams,

00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:17.880
not sacrifice everything

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.710
just for this marriage.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:37.880
Lu Ming.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.920
I did love you.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:49.550
I loved your innocence, kindness, and passion.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.070
I loved your dedication to art.

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:57.070
You had your own taste and persistence.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:01.350
I loved the one and only you

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.590
in this world.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:07.550
Xu Xin.

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.670
I haven't changed.

00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:13.280
I've always been myself.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.280
From beginning to end, I'm still me.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.280
I've said it so many times.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:18.800
Everything I did

00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.880
was just to give us a better life.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.670
Wasn't this what we always dreamed of?

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:25.190
Now we have it all.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.800
Yes, I got everything.

00:11:35.670 --> 00:11:37.800
But I've already lost you.

00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:01.550
Lu Ming.

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.550
I don't love you anymore.

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:14.710
For me,

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:19.280
and even more for you,

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:22.400
let's separate.

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:39.880
Let's get a divorce.

00:12:56.710 --> 00:12:58.070
Xu Xin, I'm telling you,

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.830
I will never divorce you.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:08.350
I won't agree to it.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.400
Do you think I've changed?

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:42.950
Tell me,

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.520
in your eyes now,

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.470
do I look like a crazy woman?

00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:38.830
I finished reading your novel.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.670
Now I finally understand.

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:45.640
Why you wrote this novel.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.670
Actually, in the novel,

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.310
the caregiver and the husband are both me, aren't they?

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.430
I've always used love as an excuse to confine you.

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.160
I often wonder,

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.120
if your life would be better without me.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:26.640
Would you be happier?

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.800
Would you meet someone who loves you more?

00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.760
Would you have chased your dream of being a dancer?

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.670
You'd have your own dance studio,

00:15:43.830 --> 00:15:45.400
and a happy family.

00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:48.350
Someone who truly loves you.

00:15:53.830 --> 00:15:56.190
You'd also pursue your literary dreams.

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.310
I remember you liked Professor Zhong in college.

00:16:04.710 --> 00:16:05.920
Would you two have ended up together?

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.880
He's probably more mature than I am,

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.710
and better at caring for your feelings.

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:20.040
Or maybe,

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.070
if I had listened to your mother back then

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.400
and chosen to leave you,

00:16:28.310 --> 00:16:29.190
would you have met

00:16:29.190 --> 00:16:30.670
a man from a better family?

00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.040
You and your mother would have been happy together.

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:41.590
Living together now.

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:45.040
You created the character Yuan You

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.760
because

00:16:47.710 --> 00:16:49.000
he's just like me.

00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:50.550
Both of us are trapped

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.000
in self-indulgent love.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:55.800
Yuan You did so much for Xu Xin,

00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.240
even things that go against all reason.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.310
To him,

00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.520
it was all an expression of love for Xu Xin.

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.760
But he never thought about

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:07.910
whether Xu Xin actually needed that twisted love.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.440
Just like me in real life,

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.870
with everything I've done to you.

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:16.110
I always thought

00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:18.520
I had to give you the best.

00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.800
But I never asked you

00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:22.870
if this was what you really wanted.

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:30.280
Xu Xin,

00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:36.150
the past can't be changed.

00:17:39.390 --> 00:17:40.680
Maybe letting go now

00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:47.800
is still possible.

00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:37.800
All your test results are normal.

00:18:38.310 --> 00:18:39.870
Did Dr. Lou give any other instructions?

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:41.110
Xu Xin.

00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:45.200
Go get the doctor, quick!

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:06.070
What do you think of this place?

00:19:07.630 --> 00:19:08.550
This is...

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.870
It's a guesthouse.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.590
I've already bought it.

00:19:11.910 --> 00:19:13.070
You bought this place?

00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.310
I told you about it.

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.240
You forgot again.

00:19:17.830 --> 00:19:18.800
Sorry.

00:19:19.390 --> 00:19:20.960
My mind is still a bit foggy.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.550
It's okay.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.830
You just woke up from a coma.

00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:26.040
The doctor said

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.070
your memory might be a bit confused for now.

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.680
It'll get better after some rest.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.910
What about Lu Ming?

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:38.280
Why bring him up?

00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.720
He still wanted to bother you after you woke up.

00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.870
But don't worry.

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:44.910
I won't let him hurt you again.

00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:47.440
Come on.

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:48.590
Let's go inside and take a look.

00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.280
You'll definitely like it here.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.760
These two walls were supposed to be painted.

00:19:53.870 --> 00:19:54.960
But I didn't let them do it.

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.760
I prefer how the walls look now.

00:19:56.760 --> 00:19:57.480
This texture.

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:00.870
Later, we can add some

00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:02.480
metal shelves here.

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:03.760
And the windows,

00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.680
the floor,

00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:06.630
we can all style them differently.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.830
And that little yard—it's really spacious.

00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:11.110
We can plant lots of greenery.

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:15.000
There aren't many rooms here,

00:20:15.110 --> 00:20:16.480
but it's very peaceful.

00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:18.960
So, what do you think?

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:19.960
Do you like it?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:22.240
I do.

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:26.550
I remember you told me back in college

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.590
that you really wanted your own guesthouse.

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.150
And live there with your best girlfriends.

00:20:31.150 --> 00:20:32.240
All of us together.

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.550
You still remember that?

00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:34.720
Of course I do.

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.200
You're my best friend.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:39.590
I remember when you were in a coma,

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:41.200
I prayed every day

00:20:41.550 --> 00:20:43.280
that heaven wouldn't take you away.

00:20:44.590 --> 00:20:45.440
But luckily,

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:46.760
a miracle happened.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.910
You finally woke up.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.070
Starting today,

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.350
you can leave the past behind.

00:20:52.550 --> 00:20:53.910
Start a new life.

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:55.630
Thank you, Xixi.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:58.800
From now on,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.240
this will be our new home.

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:02.350
Let's work hard together

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.830
to make this place a success.

00:21:03.910 --> 00:21:04.390
Okay.

00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.550
Hello.

00:21:10.550 --> 00:21:11.590
I booked a room.

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:12.830
Hello, welcome.

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.110
May I have your name, please?

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.830
The scenery here is so beautiful.

00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:50.000
Yeah, it is.

00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:55.350
I wish I could stay here forever.

00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:57.760
Of course.

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.110
How long do you want to stay here?

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:01.520
We'll stay as long as you want.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.200
Xixi.

00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:07.960
I'm afraid to leave this place.

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:12.240
Because if I do,

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.830
I'll be all alone.

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:18.440
Don't say such silly things.

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:20.520
Don't worry.

00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:22.800
I'll always be by your side.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:26.680
Promise?

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:28.150
I promise.

00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:37.390
We'll make this place even better.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.550
This is our future.
