00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.159
Some books,

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:17.040
when I read them,

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120
can fill me with many dreams.

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:23.519
Everyone here has read many classics.

00:01:23.519 --> 00:01:25.799
Many of you have your own thoughts.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.879
Who would like to share their insights?

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.959
Xu Xin,

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:37.120
I think we've all heard your opinions enough.

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:38.680
Let's have someone else speak.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.640
You, over there.

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.959
Your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:47.680
Yes.

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:48.560
Pay attention in class.

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:59.120
People often chase power, wealth, and fame.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.200
But the main character

00:02:01.519 --> 00:02:03.519
taught me a different set of values.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.480
Come, take a look at this.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.439
I get it now.

00:02:06.879 --> 00:02:07.920
Butterflies in my stomach.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.919
Better not let them flutter at the wrong time.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:11.120
What are you talking about?

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.240
I bet you're thinking right now,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.840
what Teacher Zhong's zodiac sign is.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:18.719
Scorpio or Aquarius?

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:21.719
I'm not!

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.840
That guy is really nice.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.719
He comes here every day.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.120
What's his name?

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.639
I've seen his signature.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:32.599
His name is Lu Ming.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.240
Lu Ming.

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:50.280
After art history class today,

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.879
Chen Fei confessed to me.

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:56.120
Xiao Yi,

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.080
I remember you told me

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.199
you hadn't dated before college.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.560
So you should be careful with relationships.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.800
You're our best friend.

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:08.960
We can't just watch you walk into danger.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:11.759
I'll think about it carefully.

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.520
Sorry,

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.400
for taking up a few minutes of your time.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.080
Xiao Yi,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.039
be my girlfriend.

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.919
Together! Together! Together!

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.319
Why does this girl look so much like you?

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.280
It's not just similar, it's me.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.800
Lu Ming.

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:10.240
Student,

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.639
your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.680
Yes.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.360
Do you know what you did is illegal?

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.639
Sorry,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.040
I sincerely apologize to you here.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:19.959
I'm sorry.

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.360
Is an apology all there is?

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:22.560
Xu Xin,

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.759
do you have a moment?

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.439
I'd like to talk with you.

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:28.279
About the work you submitted last time.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:29.920
Sure.

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.759
Let's talk when we have time.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.040
Xu Xin

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.519
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.160
Why?

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.240
The novella you gave me last time—

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.319
I’ve read it.

00:04:58.079 --> 00:05:00.279
So, what did you think?

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.240
I think it’s excellent.

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:06.680
I really liked it.

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.040
In all these years,

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.040
it’s the best student work I’ve ever read.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:13.360
No,

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:15.360
I shouldn’t even call it a student work.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.319
I think it can already compare

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:20.759
with the works of many top writers out there.

00:05:21.319 --> 00:05:22.439
Do you really think so?

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:24.160
I truly do.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.319
You know,

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.360
I especially loved the part about the mother-daughter relationship.

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:30.839
The daughter keeps trying to break free from her mother’s control.

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:32.399
But the mother,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.399
she’s not

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.160
a complete villain.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.439
She struggles inside.

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:38.959
She’s conflicted and in pain.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.600
That’s human nature.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.160
A good literary work must explore human nature.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.680
That’s what makes it real and vivid.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:47.240
And also,

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:49.839
the open ending at the end—

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.639
It’s like we were thinking the same thing.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.279
Xu Xin

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:56.839
I think

00:05:57.279 --> 00:05:58.639
you already have

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.519
the potential to be a professional writer.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:06.040
What’s wrong?

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.240
But I’m a dance major.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.240
I’ve been learning dance since I was little.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:15.959
My mom also hopes I’ll make a living from dance.

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:18.519
Xu Xin

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.839
Don’t live your life for other people’s expectations.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:22.720
You have your own path to follow.

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:24.240
Be brave.

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:33.120
I’m sorry.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.279
Xu Xin

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:26.839
Xiao Yi

00:07:27.079 --> 00:07:28.639
I really didn't mean to.

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.199
I just love you too much.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.079
That's why I thought

00:07:31.079 --> 00:07:32.600
you might be involved with that jerk.

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:34.199
So I wanted to check your phone.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:34.959
You wouldn't let me see it.

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:35.879
That's why I lost control.

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:38.279
I'm worse than an animal.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:39.800
Jerk.

00:07:40.519 --> 00:07:41.319
From now on,

00:07:41.399 --> 00:07:42.519
stay away from me.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:43.560
Xiao Yi

00:07:44.079 --> 00:07:45.439
Ignore this loser. Let's go.

00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:47.199
Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi!

00:07:48.639 --> 00:07:49.399
I'm sorry.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:51.879
I promise.

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:53.639
I promise I won't hurt you again.

00:07:54.519 --> 00:07:57.120
Hurting you hurts me ten thousand times more.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.240
Chen Fei

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.879
Xiao Yi, Chen Fei, what are you doing?

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:01.639
Let go of me.

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.759
Let go! What are you doing?

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.319
Chen Fei, I've really had enough.

00:08:07.839 --> 00:08:10.079
Please stay away from my friends.

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:13.040
It's completely over between us.

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:14.800
Xiao Yi, don't blame me. I'm telling you,

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.720
if you come near me or my life again,

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.879
don't blame me for calling the police.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.600
I didn't mean it, Xiao Yi.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.959
Xiao Yi, I didn't mean it.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.800
Xiao Yi

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:23.319
Xiao Yi

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:33.879
Xu Xin

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:44.440
What's wrong?

00:08:45.919 --> 00:08:48.000
Why didn't you answer my call?

00:08:56.039 --> 00:08:58.120
I really lost control that time.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.039
It was against professional ethics as a teacher.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.399
I sincerely apologize to you.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:02.720
Teacher Zhong

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.080
I've always respected you deeply.

00:09:06.399 --> 00:09:07.159
I've admired you.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.559
Of all the elective courses,

00:09:10.519 --> 00:09:12.159
yours is the only one I never miss.

00:09:12.759 --> 00:09:14.200
Every book you recommend,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.159
I read carefully.

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.320
Xu Xin

00:09:19.879 --> 00:09:20.480
Really.

00:09:20.879 --> 00:09:22.480
Of all the students I've taught,

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:23.600
you're the most gifted.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.519
That's why I lost my head that day.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.080
If you can't get over it,

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.840
you can report me to the school.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:32.639
File a complaint against me.

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:33.960
I'll accept whatever comes.

00:09:36.559 --> 00:09:37.279
Teacher Zhong

00:09:38.399 --> 00:09:39.720
I won't report you.

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.480
About this matter,

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:47.039
let's keep it a secret between us.

00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:04.919
Xu Xin

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.720
Did you have a good day today?

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:38.759
Xu Xin

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:41.200
Now that you've graduated,

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.519
we're no longer teacher and student.

00:10:44.759 --> 00:10:47.440
I hope you can accept my love.

00:10:52.759 --> 00:10:53.759
Xu Xin

00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.879
I don't want you to have to work in public after we're together.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:59.360
You won't need to show yourself at work anymore.

00:11:00.399 --> 00:11:01.600
I will make you

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.320
the happiest woman in the world.

00:11:35.159 --> 00:11:35.720
Miss,

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.120
Are you looking for a book?

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.159
I can help you.

00:11:38.679 --> 00:11:39.200
Xu Xin.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:44.240
I found it.

00:11:49.759 --> 00:11:50.360
How are you?

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:51.600
Did you find anything you like?

00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:53.759
No.

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.519
Then let's go.

00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:24.600
Lu Ming.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:26.000
Long time no see.

00:12:28.879 --> 00:12:29.840
Are you here to buy books too?

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.279
We live nearby.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:36.879
Xu Xin.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.240
I remember back in college,

00:12:38.799 --> 00:12:40.840
you and Lu Ming were good friends.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:41.600
Right?

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.720
It's been a long time now

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.559
since you last talked, hasn't it?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.120
As far as I remember,

00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.600
Lu Ming didn't come to our wedding.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.320
Yeah.

00:13:01.559 --> 00:13:02.440
You didn't invite me either.

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.120
My fault, my fault.

00:13:06.559 --> 00:13:07.960
I was too busy as a teacher.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.559
I overlooked it.

00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:09.399
Don't take it personally.

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.000
Lu Ming.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.879
I remember in college,

00:13:13.159 --> 00:13:14.240
you majored in art.

00:13:14.759 --> 00:13:15.840
So is your current job

00:13:16.279 --> 00:13:17.600
still related to your major?

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.559
Teacher Zhong still remembers me.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:21.080
Of course I do.

00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.399
You were a good student in my eyes.

00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:26.879
How's your job now?

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.759
Is it going well?

00:13:28.279 --> 00:13:29.399
No need for you to worry, Teacher Zhong.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.279
Are you married?

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:32.840
Teacher Zhong.

00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.240
Lu Ming must be busy.

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:36.559
Let's not bother him.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:37.960
Alright.

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.159
We'll get going then.

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:43.120
Let's have tea together sometime.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.919
You still call him Teacher Zhong?

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.000
After all these years?

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.440
Xu Xin is used to calling me that.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:00.720
After all, I was your teacher.

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.559
Since you knew you were her teacher,

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.240
why did you get involved with her back then?

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:05.080
Lu Ming.

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:07.000
Lu Ming.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:11.080
Xu Xin and I truly loved each other back then.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.679
Even though we were teacher and student at school,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.600
we're still just ordinary people.

00:14:16.279 --> 00:14:17.799
I don't want our love

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.440
to be defined by a label.

00:14:19.519 --> 00:14:20.600
Shut up, Zhong.

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:22.279
You might fool Xu Xin,

00:14:22.279 --> 00:14:23.240
but you can't fool everyone.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.600
You've always abused your position

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.480
to take advantage of students.

00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.399
You're not worthy of being a teacher.

00:14:27.519 --> 00:14:28.840
Lu Ming, stop it.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:29.840
You're still defending him?

00:14:30.559 --> 00:14:32.080
What he did to you back then was harassment.

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.720
I'm telling you, he's a hypocrite.

00:14:35.919 --> 00:14:37.480
Don't talk about my husband like that.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.360
We're very happy together.

00:14:57.679 --> 00:14:58.600
Let's go, Teacher Zhong.

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:03.240
Even if you don't understand our love,

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.080
I hope you can be more rational.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.840
We truly love each other.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:11.919
Let's go.

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.840
Xu Xin

00:16:21.799 --> 00:16:22.879
My two students have arrived.

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.880
Miss Xu

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:14.160
What about you?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.079
The most important thing now is to relax your mind.

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.160
Let go of your guard against everyone.

00:17:20.799 --> 00:17:22.720
Then, follow my treatment plan.

00:17:23.079 --> 00:17:24.240
We'll take it step by step.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.160
I believe you'll get better.

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.359
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

00:17:33.519 --> 00:17:34.039
You're welcome.

00:17:34.519 --> 00:17:36.880
Miss Xu, I am a doctor.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:39.519
But Dr. Xu,

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:44.319
When did you become a doctor?

00:17:47.519 --> 00:17:48.160
Miss Xu

00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.440
I don't know what you're talking about.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.440
Aren't you Lu Ming's partner?

00:17:57.319 --> 00:17:59.079
Haven't you been helping him sell art?

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.559
Would any student like to share

00:18:25.559 --> 00:18:26.759
a classic they've read?

00:18:27.839 --> 00:18:28.680
I suppose

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.000
everyone has different opinions.

00:18:33.319 --> 00:18:33.880
Xu Xin

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.319
Everyone's tired of hearing your sharing.

00:18:36.759 --> 00:18:37.759
Let's have someone else.

00:18:39.279 --> 00:18:39.960
This student here,

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.599
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:18:44.079 --> 00:18:44.599
Yes.

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.440
This marriage brought the male lead

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:48.759
both physical and emotional torment.

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.519
It's a personal tragedy and a tragedy of the era.

00:18:54.759 --> 00:18:57.000
I actually agree with you on that.

00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:01.440
I really agree with your idea.

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:02.680
I agree with your view.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.000
But regarding this

00:19:08.599 --> 00:19:10.519
marriage doomed to destruction,

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.680
both of them are victims.

00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:14.480
Xu Xin made a good point just now.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.400
So how can we avoid

00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.839
such tragedies?

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.519
The simplest way

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:22.680
is to learn from the classics.

00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.000
So how do we learn from them?

00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.599
First, what we need to do

00:19:29.079 --> 00:19:30.160
is pay attention in class.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.799
What are you doing?

00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.599
Stop filming.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.279
Sorry, sorry.

00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.640
Sorry to take up a few minutes of your time.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.200
Xiao Yi

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.119
Please give me a chance.

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:21.519
Let me love you.

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:25.960
Nonsense.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:29.119
Secretly filming is bad enough,

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.799
but now you're making a scene

00:20:30.799 --> 00:20:31.839
coming here to confess your love.

00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:34.319
I sent my child here to study

00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:37.079
because of your school's faculty and reputation.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.640
I didn't expect

00:20:39.079 --> 00:20:39.880
you'd produce

00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:41.319
so many unruly students.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.160
And you even fell in love with her.

00:20:43.759 --> 00:20:44.799
Do you know what love is?

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:46.799
Do you understand what love means?

00:20:47.079 --> 00:20:48.319
Can you take responsibility for her?

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:50.079
Does this have anything to do with you?

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.079
Of course it does.

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:52.799
I'm the parent.

00:20:53.519 --> 00:20:54.519
Her parents aren't here.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:55.960
I'm her guardian.

00:20:58.519 --> 00:20:59.160
Come home with me.

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:01.440
I won't let my child stay in a school like this.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.839
What kind of school is this?

00:21:10.039 --> 00:21:11.880
That kid looks polite enough,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:13.720
but he's always filming you.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:14.680
What is he up to?

00:21:15.359 --> 00:21:16.039
Mom,

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:18.519
It's normal for people to take photos at an art performance.

00:21:18.519 --> 00:21:19.640
Aren't you overthinking this?

00:21:20.759 --> 00:21:22.119
Has he ever been to the National Centre for the Performing Arts?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.839
Has he ever been to the People's Theatre?

00:21:24.119 --> 00:21:25.200
Can you just film anywhere you want?

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.119
And that public confession,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.799
none of the teachers present

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:31.400
even tried to stop it.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.839
We're all college students now.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.279
College students are still students.

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.960
If teachers don't stop it, they're encouraging it.

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.759
No, I have to withdraw you from school.

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:45.839
I'll handle the paperwork next week.

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.920
Mom, I've already studied here for three years.

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.759
I only have one year left before graduation.

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.519
If I drop out now,

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:54.799
where can I go?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.960
Fine, you don't have to drop out.

00:21:59.279 --> 00:22:00.079
Then come back home to live.

00:22:00.359 --> 00:22:01.519
I'll have someone pick you up and drop you off every day.

00:22:02.559 --> 00:22:03.680
Do we really have to do this?

00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:07.599
I'm not discussing this with you.

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.119
Either come home,

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:10.279
or drop out.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:11.160
You choose.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.079
Xiao Yi, I'm sorry.

00:22:57.079 --> 00:22:58.200
I really didn't mean it.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.039
It's just that I love you so much.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:00.920
That's why I thought

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.559
you might be involved with that jerk.

00:23:43.599 --> 00:23:45.079
Xin Xin, get up!

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:46.720
Today is your graduation day.

00:23:48.279 --> 00:23:48.680
Hurry up!

00:23:55.079 --> 00:23:56.279
I graduated.

00:23:57.599 --> 00:23:58.200
That's right.

00:24:04.039 --> 00:24:04.599
Mom.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:06.839
I want to continue studying dance.

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.920
Now that you've graduated, my job is done.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.160
The rest of my job

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.079
is to find you a good family to marry into.

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.240
Get married?

00:24:17.319 --> 00:24:17.960
Exactly.

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:20.440
While you're young, you have more choices.

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:22.279
Plus, your mom knows a lot of people.

00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:23.960
I'll definitely find you a good match.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.359
Don't worry.

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:26.680
I've been looking out for you.

00:24:37.759 --> 00:24:39.920
Today's blind date is someone important.

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.039
He's the eldest son of the Zheng family.

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:43.480
His father owns a factory.

00:24:43.759 --> 00:24:44.880
They're worth billions.

00:24:45.559 --> 00:24:46.839
Because you're beautiful,

00:24:46.839 --> 00:24:48.839
he really liked you after seeing your photo.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.519
So the meeting was arranged right away.

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.839
Even though our family is decent,

00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.200
compared to them,

00:24:54.319 --> 00:24:55.759
we really pale in comparison.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.160
So make sure you do well later.

00:24:58.799 --> 00:24:59.920
If this works out,

00:25:00.279 --> 00:25:01.759
you'll never have to worry for generations.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:02.599
Understand?

00:25:04.559 --> 00:25:05.720
Would you like something to drink?

00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:07.880
Two lattes to start.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:09.440
We'll order the rest later.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.440
Okay.

00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.519
Stop talking about useless things.

00:25:13.599 --> 00:25:14.519
Touch up your makeup quickly.

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.599
He's coming soon.

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.119
Alright, I know. I'll stop talking.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.000
Aunt Zhang.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:27.319
I'm really sorry.

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.160
I was late because of work.

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:33.359
You must be Miss Xu Xin.

00:25:33.759 --> 00:25:35.640
You're even more beautiful in person.

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:36.799
Let me introduce myself.

00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:37.720
My name is Zheng Zhi.

00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.519
Hello, nice to meet you.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:42.039
I was just talking with Mr. Zhang from Tianyuan Tech.

00:25:42.039 --> 00:25:43.000
We were discussing a project.

00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.640
He insisted I invest.

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:45.720
That's why I was delayed.

00:25:48.839 --> 00:25:49.559
Let's sit and talk.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:50.400
Please, sit.

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:53.960
Zheng,

00:25:54.119 --> 00:25:55.759
what project did you discuss today?

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:57.279
Artificial intelligence.

00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.200
It's the most cutting-edge technology now.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:00.920
That's impressive.

00:26:01.720 --> 00:26:02.680
It's nothing, really.

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.279
I can't be Elon Musk,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:05.160
but I aim

00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:07.160
to have someone from my company

00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.200
become the next Elon Musk.

00:26:09.559 --> 00:26:10.359
The future looks bright.

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:12.160
Whoever marries you

00:26:12.279 --> 00:26:13.680
will be truly blessed.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:14.680
Auntie, you're too kind.

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:16.359
With such a beautiful daughter,

00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:17.839
if I could marry Miss Xu,

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:21.119
that would be a blessing of a lifetime.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:25.000
Mr. Zheng, I heard you love reading.

00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:26.960
Xin Xin loves reading too.

00:26:27.119 --> 00:26:28.880
Looks like you have something in common.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:31.559
What do you usually read, Mr. Zheng?

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.920
Biographies of Buffett.

00:26:33.559 --> 00:26:35.680
Because Buffett is my idol.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.880
Is that so?

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Right, Xin?

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:05.759
Xin?

00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.359
Yes, that's right.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:09.240
Yes.

00:27:09.519 --> 00:27:11.720
Miss Xu, have you studied dance before?

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:15.880
No wonder you have such great poise and presence.

00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:16.680
How about this—

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.559
I'm hosting a party at my house tonight.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.119
Miss Xu, would you dance for us?

00:27:20.559 --> 00:27:23.039
I'm sure you'll amaze everyone.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:23.799
Thank you.

00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.039
I don't think that's necessary.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:28.119
That's great!

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.160
Don't worry.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.960
Xin Xin will definitely do her best.

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:31.640
Right?

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:52.759
Where's Xu Xin?

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.519
I just called.

00:27:55.519 --> 00:27:56.640
She said something came up.

00:27:56.640 --> 00:27:57.559
She'll be here soon.

00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.599
Let's not wait any longer.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:02.480
Mr. Zheng,

00:28:02.839 --> 00:28:04.519
Your wife has to be here.

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:05.920
Let's wait a bit more.

00:28:08.599 --> 00:28:10.359
Since Mr. Wang said so,

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:11.960
let's wait a little longer.

00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:16.559
Sorry I'm late.

00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.759
What could be more important than dinner?

00:28:21.319 --> 00:28:22.559
I had something urgent.

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.039
Sorry about that.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.759
Mr. Zheng, we've all had a round.

00:28:28.119 --> 00:28:30.240
Should your wife have a penalty drink?

00:28:32.359 --> 00:28:33.319
A penalty drink.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:35.079
That's no fun.

00:28:36.279 --> 00:28:37.359
Xu Xin is my wife.

00:28:38.319 --> 00:28:39.400
She's a great dancer.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:40.680
How about this?

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:44.000
I'll have her dance for everyone.

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.480
To liven things up.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:46.319
Sounds good.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:54.079
But my outfit isn't suitable today.

00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:57.279
Xin Xin, you were already late.

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.920
Don't spoil the mood.

00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:02.920
Alright.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.079
Xu Xin

00:30:15.319 --> 00:30:15.960
Xu Xin

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:18.759
Xu Xin

00:30:21.599 --> 00:30:22.759
Xu Xin, what are you thinking about?

00:30:34.559 --> 00:30:35.119
Mom

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.559
There's something I want to tell you.

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:40.319
Go ahead.

00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:44.160
Zheng Zhi talked to me a few days ago.

00:30:45.359 --> 00:30:46.079
He said

00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:48.880
he wants to have a child.

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.160
Isn't that a good thing?

00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.960
But what if I don't want one?

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:57.359
Let me tell you,

00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:58.559
as a woman,

00:30:58.559 --> 00:30:59.519
if you don't have a child,

00:30:59.519 --> 00:31:00.960
you're not a complete woman.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.200
I think Zheng Zhi's idea is pretty good.

00:31:03.359 --> 00:31:04.759
You should hurry up and get ready.

00:31:06.079 --> 00:31:07.160
That's for later.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.640
Let's talk about tomorrow first.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:10.200
Tomorrow, you must

00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.519
dress up nicely for me.

00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:13.079
Your sister is coming to see us.

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.000
Sister?

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:20.440
Since when do I have a sister?

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.200
I'm mad at her.

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.359
You're still mad at her?

00:31:25.799 --> 00:31:27.400
I think she won't come alone.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.680
She'll definitely bring that annoying Lu Ming with her.

00:31:30.319 --> 00:31:31.000
Seriously...

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:33.079
Lu Ming

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.440
Who is my sister?

00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:45.960
Your sister is Xu Xin.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:57.599
Then who am I?

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.160
Silly girl.

00:32:00.559 --> 00:32:02.200
You're Xu Xin.

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:11.319
I don't have a sister.

00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.720
I...

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.039
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

00:32:19.799 --> 00:32:20.759
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:25.039
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:26.799
I don't want to see Xu Xin.

00:32:27.079 --> 00:32:28.920
I don't want to see, I don't want to see Xu Xin.

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:29.720
Xu Xin

00:32:30.359 --> 00:32:31.440
Xu Xin, what's wrong?

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.200
Xu Xin

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.279
Can you hear us talking?

00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:10.359
Can you hear us talking?

00:33:10.559 --> 00:33:11.160
Xu Xin

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.400
Hold on a little longer.

00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:13.359
Don't leave us.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.279
Don't come over here.

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.000
Xu Xin

00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.759
Don't come over here.

00:33:17.279 --> 00:33:17.799
Xu Xin

00:33:17.799 --> 00:33:18.440
Don't come over here.
