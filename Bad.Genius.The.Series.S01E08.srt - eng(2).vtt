Hello.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:13.013
This is Atasha Muhlach playing the role
as Lin from BAD GENIUS: THE SERIES

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.581
So here it is, guys.

00:00:14.581 --> 00:00:15.982
Maybe most of you might not know

00:00:15.982 --> 00:00:19.019
I have been playing the
piano since I was a kid.

00:00:27.328 --> 00:00:29.697
I told you! Another one!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.000
There you have it.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.071
That’s why I was happy when I learned that
Lin in BAD GENIUS plays the piano.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.875
At in the scenes where she plays
the instrument, she expresses her emotions

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.009
through the piano.

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:44.210
So for today.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.246
The Bad Genius team

00:00:46.246 --> 00:00:49.249
will give me some challenge.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:52.052
I don't know if it really is a challenge.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.295
So we have a wheel of emotions here

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:56.523
whichever gets chosen

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.259
I need to play the piano
ithat matches that emotion

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:02.529
So in short, whatever emotion they show me

00:01:02.613 --> 00:01:06.183
I need to match that
emotion using the piano.

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.567
Let's go. Lin.

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:10.770
Okay, we’ll do freestyle so it’s fun

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.238
Oh, kilig!

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.041
Disgust!

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:20.109
Disgust is like this right?

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.720
Here!

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.690
Does it sound right?

00:01:33.561 --> 00:01:35.330
Let’s try another one.

00:01:35.355 --> 00:01:38.073
Anxiety or love? Love?

00:01:38.098 --> 00:01:41.034
Love, love, love!

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.036
Happiness. Happiness.

00:01:43.036 --> 00:01:46.039
Here happiness!

00:01:55.482 --> 00:01:56.416
That's happy.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.151
That's your childhood flashback.

00:01:58.151 --> 00:02:01.321
Lady Gaga. Caught in a bad romance.

00:02:06.893 --> 00:02:08.194
Fear.

00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.929
I have something in mind.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.074
It feels like a horror movie.
You feel someone is chasing you.

00:02:21.074 --> 00:02:22.242
I’m not sure.

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:24.544
It’s as if you’re crazy.

00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:28.311
Ok, what’s next?

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.988
Excitement!

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:39.792
That's excitement.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:42.228
And actually,
that's one of the tools that Lin uses

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:45.231
to express herself with one of the letters
in the exams.

00:02:45.231 --> 00:02:48.234
This is excitement.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:51.304
That’s one of the cheat sheets

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.965
in Bad Genius so please
watch it on Viva One.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.612
Surprise!

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.615
Oh, surprise

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:06.986
Next is sadness.

00:03:15.094 --> 00:03:17.130
That’s it!

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.201
Anger + Anxiety?

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.204
How about this?

00:03:24.521 --> 00:03:27.724
I can’t play that song.
Maybe I’ll just try the chords.

00:03:37.812 --> 00:03:39.452
Not so sure about that!

00:03:39.452 --> 00:03:43.423
That’s anger and anxiety mixed together.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.493
Next is Kilig!

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:52.198
So this song is a Kilig song because

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.235
it comes after the movie

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:58.504
that most of you might know,
which is Sana Maulit Muli.

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:03.543
Featuring another Viva artist

00:04:03.543 --> 00:04:05.945
Being my father, Aga Muhlach!

00:04:05.945 --> 00:04:08.314
I love you, Dad!

00:04:08.314 --> 00:04:10.859
