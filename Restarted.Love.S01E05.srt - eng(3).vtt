00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.200
Stop running.

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:14.640
Come here, come here, this way.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.239
Give it to me.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.959
Stop running.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:17.959
Come here.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.239
Stop running, you'll fall!

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.760
Stop messing around.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.280
Come on, sit down nicely.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.920
Why are you dressed like that?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:43.920
It still fits, right?

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.840
Thank you.

00:01:48.519 --> 00:01:49.239
Sorry for the trouble.

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.920
It's fine.

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:01.159
Is this the right address?

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.080
Sorry, I really troubled you.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.599
But I really don't know who else to ask.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.759
So what are we going to do?

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.639
I don't know how to explain it to you.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.680
Hello, are you here to see the apartment?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.680
I've heard about it before.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.039
I heard you're preparing a new exhibition.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.639
What's the theme?

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.400
When will it open?

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.199
If you don't like it, you don't have to come back.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.599
Weren't you pretty determined when you left?

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:37.439
Happy anniversary.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.360
Your mom is in Meiling, right?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.680
Can you take me somewhere else?

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.959
Over there.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.600
Mom

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.639
Xin Xin

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.040
Xin Xin, is that you?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:28.240
You... you came to see me.

00:05:29.839 --> 00:05:31.439
You came to see me, didn't you?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.800
Why didn't you let me know?

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.879
At least you could have called me.

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:37.439
Sit down, quick.

00:05:37.959 --> 00:05:40.079
Let me get you some water.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.639
Water, water.

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:42.199
Let me do it.

00:05:42.279 --> 00:05:42.920
Water.

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:49.720
The hot water is outside.

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.399
You haven't changed a bit.

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:07.720
Why are you living here all alone?

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:13.839
Your aunt brought me here.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.560
What about Xu Yuan? Why isn't she taking care of you?

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.879
Xu Yuan

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:24.199
Xu

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.279
Xu Yuan, my sister.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:32.079
I only have you as my daughter.

00:06:33.519 --> 00:06:34.959
Do you still remember when we were kids,

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:36.360
how we used to dance together?

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:40.079
What if I told you you never had a sister, you're an only child?

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:41.079
Would you believe me?

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:45.399
I'm telling you, I don't want to stay here.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.079
People here aren't nice to me at all.

00:06:48.759 --> 00:06:50.040
I suspect one of the caregivers

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.879
she stole my money, you know?

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.600
Can you take me away?

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:56.040
Please, I'm begging you, take me away, okay?

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:06.040
Aren't you here to take me out?

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.160
Where's Lu Ming?

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:14.759
Where is Lu Ming? Lu Ming?

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:15.360
Here's the water.

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:30.399
Who is he? Is he your husband?

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.560
You and Lu Ming broke up.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:38.399
I told you a long time ago,

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:40.480
Lu Ming isn't right for you.

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:42.600
If you stay with him,

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:45.040
he'll ruin everything for you, you know?

00:07:45.399 --> 00:07:46.759
He's a bad person.

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.920
He's always tried to take you away from me.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.560
He's always done that.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:54.079
I've always told him to give you back to me.

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.040
But he never listens.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120
So I went to beg him.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.160
I even got on my knees.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.000
I begged him, please leave Xu Xin, please.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.160
I got on my knees, you know?

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:16.839
What did you say to Lu Ming?

00:08:20.439 --> 00:08:22.360
I'm still with Lu Ming.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.319
Then why did you come here?

00:08:33.399 --> 00:08:34.480
To laugh at me?

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.840
Are you here to make fun of me?

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.840
Let me tell you, I'm doing great.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.919
I'm really happy here.

00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.799
Everyone treats me so well.

00:08:47.919 --> 00:08:49.519
Look, they're all smiling.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.200
Everyone is so nice to me.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.679
The environment is so nice, everything's green.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.519
Isn't it?

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.120
I'm really happy here.

00:08:56.159 --> 00:08:58.240
I'm not lonely, not at all.

00:08:58.559 --> 00:09:00.279
I'm very happy, you know?

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.200
Since you're not here to take me home,

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:03.919
then leave.

00:09:04.039 --> 00:09:05.360
Hurry up and go.

00:09:05.679 --> 00:09:06.519
Go!

00:09:06.679 --> 00:09:08.480
Don't let me see you here again.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.320
Nurse, tell them to leave, nurse!

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.799
I don't want to see them again.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.639
Go, I don't want to see them.

00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.039
Nurse! Nurse!

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:32.960
Can you tell me the reason?

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.519
Just take the money, that's all.

00:10:36.399 --> 00:10:37.120
Ask what you should ask.

00:10:37.759 --> 00:10:38.960
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.919
Otherwise, I'll expose your past.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:43.840
When that happens,

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.360
it won't just ruin your reputation.

00:10:48.759 --> 00:10:50.200
Don't bring this up again.

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:52.240
I used to do that, but I've changed.

00:10:52.879 --> 00:10:54.879
No need to explain. I don't care.

00:10:56.519 --> 00:10:58.320
Just do as I say.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.919
Where should I take you later?

00:11:24.159 --> 00:11:25.600
I don't know where I can go.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.320
Let me find a place for you.

00:11:36.159 --> 00:11:37.919
I don't know what happened to you,

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.320
but I got you a volunteer spot.

00:11:40.639 --> 00:11:42.279
You can stay here tonight.

00:11:44.519 --> 00:11:45.200
Thank you.

00:11:47.879 --> 00:11:50.559
So what exactly happened today?

00:11:55.919 --> 00:11:56.720
If you don't want to talk, that's fine.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:58.480
Yuan You.

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:06.759
Do you really want to know?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.639
Did you understand what I said?

00:12:25.559 --> 00:12:26.600
The people you've met

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.600
all suddenly disappeared without reason.

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:30.039
Including your sister.

00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.720
No one in this world except you

00:12:35.799 --> 00:12:36.960
remembers them.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.480
You even suspect it's related to your husband.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.279
Doesn't this sound made up?

00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:52.960
It does sound like it.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:00.720
But it's not impossible.

00:13:01.159 --> 00:13:02.639
I've read novels online

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:03.960
where people travel back in time.

00:13:04.639 --> 00:13:05.559
Nothing strange about it.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.879
Do you really believe what I'm saying?

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.559
I have no reason not to believe you.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:16.919
At least you don't seem crazy right now.

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.919
Wait, what are you doing?

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:39.960
Here they come.

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.639
Why did you ask me to come here?

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:51.200
I want to talk to you.

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:53.720
How should I continue your interview?

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:57.639
Should I interview your wife?

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:02.159
To see if she truly remembers nothing.

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:07.960
I'm warning you, stay away from Xu Xin.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:10.360
Are you threatening me?

00:14:13.799 --> 00:14:14.960
I wonder if your wife

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.600
has ever seen you like this.

00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:17.919
Would she be scared?

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.639
But I told you,

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:24.519
I can accept what she can't.

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.440
Since she remembers nothing,

00:14:29.759 --> 00:14:31.759
why not give yourself a chance?

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.480
If you choose to leave her now,

00:14:34.879 --> 00:14:36.320
she won't be sad.

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:41.120
Admitting your relationship is over

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.799
is it really that hard?

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:43.679
Lin Qing.

00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.799
I don't know why you're so obsessed with me.

00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:49.120
But I advise you to stop.

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:51.679
Otherwise,

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.279
I really don't know

00:14:53.279 --> 00:14:54.759
what I might do.

00:15:04.039 --> 00:15:06.000
Since you're so clear, Lu Ming,

00:15:07.039 --> 00:15:08.240
I have nothing more to say.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.799
But let me remind you, as an adult,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.480
you're responsible for all your actions.

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.240
I hope you won't regret your choice today.

00:16:14.039 --> 00:16:14.840
Xiao Tangyuan

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:35.679
Xiao Tangyuan

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.519
Kids,

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.360
The brain is a truly amazing thing.

00:16:54.879 --> 00:16:55.679
It's fascinating.

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:57.919
Just by imagining,

00:16:57.919 --> 00:16:58.840
we can do so many

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.840
incredible things.

00:17:00.159 --> 00:17:02.080
Okay, listen to my instructions now.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.120
Close your eyes.

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.000
Breathe in with my rhythm.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.440
Breathe out.

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:13.599
Imagine in your life

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:16.079
the spiciest thing you've ever eaten.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:18.920
Picture what it looks like.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.000
Its shape.

00:17:21.759 --> 00:17:23.000
Its color.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:24.839
How is it?

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:26.839
Isn't it super spicy?

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.559
Spicy! So spicy! It's killing me!

00:17:28.559 --> 00:17:29.920
I've never eaten anything spicy.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.519
Really?

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:31.839
So spicy!

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:34.759
It's so spicy! Tasty things are always spicy.

00:17:35.039 --> 00:17:36.240
I never eat spicy food.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:36.720
Really?

00:17:36.839 --> 00:17:37.759
Yesterday's wasn't spicy either.

00:17:37.759 --> 00:17:39.279
I've never had anything spicy.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.640
Let's play again, okay?

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.039
Close your eyes.

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.359
Okay, okay, okay.

00:17:47.119 --> 00:17:47.960
Imagine

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:49.359
in your life

00:17:49.839 --> 00:17:52.440
the most wonderful smell you've ever smelled.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.839
Picture what it looks like.

00:17:58.640 --> 00:17:59.799
Its shape.

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:03.319
When did you smell it?

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.119
How did you feel when you smelled it?

00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:11.680
Now breathe in.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:14.079
Breathe out.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:19.440
Then slowly open your eyes.

00:18:25.079 --> 00:18:26.079
Smell your own hand.

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:28.799
Does it smell nice?

00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:31.440
How is it?

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:33.920
Isn't there a really nice smell?

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:36.759
So fragrant! So fragrant!

00:18:37.279 --> 00:18:40.240
I like it. It's like Teacher He's perfume.

00:18:46.119 --> 00:18:48.720
I didn't expect to really smell something.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.200
So what did you smell?

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.400
Incense stick.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.640
There was a temple next to my house when I was little.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:00.400
My mom took me there to pray for blessings.

00:19:02.279 --> 00:19:04.079
I loved that smell back then.

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:08.920
I had forgotten about it before.

00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:11.799
You made me remember it again.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.160
This is actually a kind of self-suggestion.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:17.839
Some deep memories

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.359
are always hidden in our minds.

00:19:19.759 --> 00:19:20.680
It's no big deal.

00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:24.559
So how do you know all this?

00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:26.039
Where are you going?

00:20:29.359 --> 00:20:32.279
There have been a lot of problems between us.

00:20:33.359 --> 00:20:35.279
I want to move out for a while.

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:41.200
If you think we really have a problem,

00:20:43.519 --> 00:20:45.079
we can sit down and talk about it.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:46.720
What do you think?

00:20:55.319 --> 00:20:56.559
Are you going to see that man again?

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:58.799
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:02.720
I just need some space and time for myself.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.279
To figure things out.

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:08.160
We've been stuck in this situation

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.559
for a long time now.

00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:13.559
Right now,

00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:16.319
I just know I can't stay here anymore.

00:21:17.119 --> 00:21:18.400
You can't leave here.

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:24.880
How are you going to stop me?
