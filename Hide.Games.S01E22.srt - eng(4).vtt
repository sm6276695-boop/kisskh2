00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.080
Don't hurt her.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.600
I know who you are now.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.760
It's my fault.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.240
Where are you?

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.200
I'll go and see you.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.160
Let's end this for good.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.720
Alright.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.840
The abandoned building in the old town.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.960
The place where you fell.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.020
I'll be waiting there.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.200
Remember.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.420
You have just one hour.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.870
Who is this?

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.160
My brother's taken Doctor Chen.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.360
He's in the old town.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.240
You remember now?

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.320
Didn't your brother...

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.370
Get your people there now.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.260
Or it'll be too late.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.760
Sure, I'm heading there now.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.120
Before I arrive,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.180
don't do anything rash.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.000
Hello?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.240
Right on time this time.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.720
Cut the talk; where are you?

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.680
Look up.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.560
No need to rush.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:34.360
Han Yu.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.520
I know you're Han Yu.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:40.760
Let her go.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.980
You've got the wrong person.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.840
Disappointed?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.040
He still doesn't remember you.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.520
I'm telling you the truth.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.200
I haven't seen her in over a decade.

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.160
She's just my doctor.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.840
Let her go. You've got the wrong one.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.200
What a shame.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:05.760
She's the one you loved most.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.560
Too bad she's of no use now.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.160
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:18.320
Don't move.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.320
Move closer, and she'll be gone.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.800
You'd better hold on to me.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.040
Don't you lose me.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.640
Hold on to me.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.640
Don't you lose me.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.840
I've decided.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.840
Her name's Nuo.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.560
From now on, take care of us.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.720
Don't you lose us.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.160
Why does it feel like they all know me?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.050
Morning, ma'am.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.040
Xu, you're back.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:48.360
Let's go.

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:50.780
Xu, I've been saving this money
in secret.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
It should be enough for us to get by.

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:53.200
Let's leave now.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.660
Xu.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.200
I know a path we can take to leave.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.280
Come with me.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.600
Xiao Ran

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.760
is nothing but trouble.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.680
This is all my fault.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.920
Punish me if you want; don't hurt her.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.040
Don't hurt her.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.220
You have to trust yourself.

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.780
(Two months ago)

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.360
Let my wife go.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.240
If you have a problem,
take it out on me.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:01.400
Don't move.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.320
What do you want?

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.760
Still as selfish as ever.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.160
What does Xiao Ran's death

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.640
even mean to you?

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.320
Xiao Ran and An Shaocong's deaths

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.940
were likely Wang Mingcheng's doing.

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.560
That's nonsense.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:29.520
I'm the one who killed An Shaocong.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.520
When I got there, Xiao Ran was dead.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120
An Shaocong killed Xiao Ran.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.280
That's impossible.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.380
Xiao Ran was always our informant.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.300
What do you even know?

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.880
I'm asking you.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.780
What do you even know?

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.320
You know nothing at all.

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.080
Why would she be your informant?

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.360
I'm asking you.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.200
Why would she be your informant?

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:20.280
She did it for me.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:29.760
Son.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:31.440
I got all this for you.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.120
How is it?

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.280
That's enough.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:42.680
I can pull it off.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:44.720
Good.

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:49.560
You're so smart.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.960
You stay here and focus

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.200
on getting that refined formula,

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:00.360
and we'll live a wealthy life.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:02.480
Godfather.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.680
I can't finish the experiment alone.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.360
Where's the helper I asked for?

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:11.160
Come in.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.440
Why are you doing this?

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:45.960
Why keep sabotaging my experiment?

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.660
Are you afraid
that once I get the formula,

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.600
I'll be valued more,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.040
and then I'll treat you

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.440
however I want?

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:01.400
I knew you looked down on me.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Xiao Ran, listen to me.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.640
If you don't like me,

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.480
you can just say it.

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.720
You don't need to...

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.360
Xiao Ran.

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.400
Xu.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.160
When I was little,

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:33.840
our village was taken over by dealers.

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.400
My parents were killed by them.

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.320
I hate them.

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.720
I hate those drugs.

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:42.960
But you're different.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.640
You're a genius.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.080
Once you create this refined formula,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:50.840
more families will suffer,

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.360
just like mine did.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.560
I like you.

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:57.120
But I can't let you succeed.

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.560
If I don't make it,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.360
we're both done for.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.760
Let's just run.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.000
We can't run.

00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.360
Run where?

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.280
I've been running my whole life.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:14.440
Never once made it out.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.080
I can't escape this sea of poppies.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.520
Listen to me.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:20.760
These things

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:22.640
are all we have to bargain with.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.520
Once I crack this formula,

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.920
we can buy our freedom for life.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.480
You have to trust me.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.760
When the Formula works,

00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.300
I'll never touch this stuff again.

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:35.400
- No.
- Trust me on this.

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:36.440
- No.
- Trust me on this.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.480
You can't keep doing this.

00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.360
Trust me.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.960
No.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.360
Xu.

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.720
I don't want to touch drugs either.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:09:58.640
Do you think I want this?

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:03.880
I'm disabled.

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:04.980
I know you look down on me.

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.280
This is the only way
I feel worth something.

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.800
Why do I do it?

00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.040
Because I want freedom.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.200
I want you to be free, too.

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.760
So, you like Xiao Ran.

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.840
It's not just liking her.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:26.840
I love her.

00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.080
I was so close.

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.880
One step away from taking her far away

00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:37.860
to live somewhere quiet and peaceful.

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.040
Just one more step.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.880
Then I met you.

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.880
You ruined everything, you know?

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.440
Hurry! Han Xu's coming with people.

00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.600
It's a covert operation.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.640
Alright, got it.

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:53.360
What happened, Godfather?

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.520
The police are here. Go now!

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.080
What about Xiao Ran?

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.680
I'll have someone protect her. Go!

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.040
No, I have to save her!

00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:01.160
Wang Yu!

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.160
Wang Yu!

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.600
Hurry up!

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.800
Hurry!

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:18.160
Got it.

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.240
I'll wire you the money.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.640
Where are they?

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.080
Well?

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:33.680
Any news on Xiao Ran?

00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.480
The An guy

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.560
is after her beauty.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.760
During the police raid,

00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:43.160
he kidnapped Xiao Ran.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.480
I've let you down

00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.600
on this.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.480
The priority now

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:53.280
is for you to write down the formula,

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.160
so we can make a comeback.

00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.280
Where did they take Xiao Ran?

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.160
The eastern suburbs.

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:03.920
It's already come to this.

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.640
Give me the formula first.

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.320
I'll give you the formula.

00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.440
But not now.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:10.360
Also,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.480
I have a term to trade.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.160
Help me track down someone.

00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:15.400
His name's Han Xu.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.120
He looks exactly like me.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.280
Who is he?

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:19.520
Why do you need him?

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:20.380
Revenge.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:25.720
You ruined me once.

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.920
Now, you've ruined me again.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.270
Every time I try

00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:36.720
to live quietly and peacefully,

00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.240
you tear my life apart.

00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:44.880
But that's fine.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.080
You ruined me,

00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.240
and I'll ruin you too.

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.840
Do you know what I'm gonna do next?

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:56.680
I'm going to kill you.

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.080
I'll kill your Yasin too.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:01.200
Also,

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.040
I'm making Nuo

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.440
my daughter,

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:07.580
so she can suffer

00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:08.750
every bit of pain

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.680
I've been through.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.320
How's that?

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.280
Not a chance.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.800
Yasin,

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:25.960
Nuo,

00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:27.120
I'm sorry.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.710
Dad, my teacher praised me today.

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.920
Dad, you're finally back.

00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.880
Look.

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:39.040
Thanks, Dad.

00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:40.520
Good girl.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.920
Glad you like it.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:49.640
Seems you really like this pendant.

00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:51.880
My dad gave it to me.

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:54.120
I've always treated it as my amulet.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.960
Now, I want you to have it.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:59.760
When we meet again,

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.960
you can give it back to me.

00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:17.220
(Memory recovery: 100%)

00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:19.500
(The brothers' face-off
unlocks his memory.)
