Rey

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.600
What's the matter with you?

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.800
Ow!

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.320
Why so frightened?

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.280
My arms are gonna bruise!

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.880
Ow, be gentle...

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.040
So, earlier...

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.320
What was the sweet dream about?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.880
I noticed you smiling for quite a while.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.240
What are you talking about?
That's baloney!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
It was a nightmare!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.840
Since coming home from Chanthaburi...

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.840
you've been acting weird.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.880
Or is there anything
you haven't told me?

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.000
Nope!

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.600
I...

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.720
I'm completely fine.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.640
"Fine."

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.480
Hm...

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.040
Or is it...

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.440
Is it...

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.800
that you miss...

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.400
home!

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.120
You're homesick, aren't you?

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.600
Yeah!

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.320
I am homesick.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.680
I'm off to take a shower!

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Hold on!

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.040
Hurry up with the shower,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.920
so we can rehearse the script.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:44.920
Alright,

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.000
this is the scene where you realize
your feelings have changed,

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080
so you confess your love.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.840
I'll be your partner.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.720
For the confession scene?

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.320
Mm.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.600
With you?

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.440
Mm.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:02.800
Why?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.360
Don't tell me...

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.360
you've never confessed your love
to anyone.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:13.560
Mm!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.440
It's actually true.

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.320
I'm the one
people confessed their love to.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.360
Alright, alright.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.080
Though you haven't done so,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.840
you must've had feelings for someone,

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.360
mustn't you?

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.560
Try imagining your crush's face

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.360
for this scene.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.160
My crush's face...

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.960
I'm not exactly sure
what happened between us

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:11.280
or when my feelings for you

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.560
started to change.

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.880
Should there be anything on your mind,

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.360
just say it frankly.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.400
I...

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.240
love you.

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:10.160
Wow, that was quite a performance!

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.320
Yay me!

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.440
Yay.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.240
Just got a compliment from The Rey.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400
So...

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:28.440
whose face did you think of

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.800
that got you so into the scene?

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.080
No one! I...

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.040
was just tired of you whining,

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.360
so I got it done in one go.

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.400
Is that so?

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.400
With that much fluster...

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.120
I'd say you're having
a crush on someone.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.200
Are you?

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760
You're just yapping.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:11.400
What the hell is wrong with you, Print?!

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.160
Is your crush...

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.120
on the set with us?

00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.680
And why do I have to tell you?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.280
Well,

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.800
maybe I can help you with that.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.320
I can befriend them in your body.

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.960
Not telling ya.

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.360
You're not telling me...

00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.360
Then, that would mean...

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.000
they're here.

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.680
I can understand that

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.680
since this industry
is filled with good-looking people.

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.080
If you developed feelings for someone
after working together,

00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:35.440
it wouldn't be surprising,

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:38.080
would it?

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.200
You have fallen for someone
you worked with?

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.800
No,

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.200
I'm professional enough.

00:08:57.760 --> 00:08:59.000
If you won't tell,
it's up to you.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.280
I'm not particularly interested
in your business.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.880
Whoa,

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.240
that's what you called "not interested"?

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:12.680
Rey, are you free?
I have something to talk to you about.

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.120
This industry
is filled with good-looking people.

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:36.840
If you developed feelings for someone
after working together,

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.520
it wouldn't be surprising.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.800
Fon.

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.800
Huh?

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.800
If you put down someone's name
in the contact with an emoji,

00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.880
does that mean they're special to you?

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.680
Uh... I guess so.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.400
But for someone...

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.520
that might have only been true
in the past.

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.520
For example,

00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:20.760
it was just there for so long
that you forgot to change it.

00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.320
Why are you asking?

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:26.920
Just because.

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:34.280
No matter what,

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.360
I want you to know

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.600
you're the only one
I want to spend my life with.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.800
But it's impossible for us
to be together, Mr. Prachak.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.240
- You're now betrothed to Miss Rin.
- Do you think...

00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.360
everyone will like the first episode?

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.160
Why are you zoning out?

00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:05.080
You made it as the female lead;

00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:07.160
don't you wanna see your work?

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:12.080
Turn your hair soft and silky

00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.440
with Dyfun.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.960
Dyfun,

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.200
a blow dryer from your dream.

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:33.240
Are you and Auer close?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.760
Well...

00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.560
We've known each other
since we started in the industry.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.120
Why do you ask?

00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:46.760
I'll go take a shower.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.160
I'll catch up on the rerun.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.000
Auer and Rey are just the thing!

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:08.120
Auer and Rey's chemistry
is through the roof!

00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:10.360
Don't you dare get closer to Auer.

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.640
What a pain in the butt!

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.360
She's obviously throwing herself at him.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.960
She's so desperate
to pair up with him.

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.120
Rey's such a pick-me.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.120
It's like she couldn't
get enough of her fame.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.320
Auer's fandom is high-key scary!

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.520
You want me to film a vlog with Auer?!

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:37.440
The first episode aired
created a strong sensation for AuerRey,

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.720
so the client wants you
to film a vlog every week from now on.

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.720
But...

00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.960
I'll take care of it, Mai.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.640
Hey, guys!

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.880
You're with us in
"AuerRey Touring the Set."

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.320
We're now approaching the last scenes,
aren't we, Rey?

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.200
Yes.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.680
I wonder if someone here will miss me
after we finish filming...

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:17.880
Someone here?

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:19.760
Don't think so.

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.200
Try your luck over there.

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.320
Rey probably means everyone on set

00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.240
since we'll definitely be missing
The Doll Mansion crew so badly.

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:41.160
You don't seem like that
with other people.

00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:44.600
What exactly is going on?

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:58.680
Why are you here?

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.560
What...are you doing?

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.920
Just hold still.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:42.920
Right,

00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.640
how was the vlog with Auer?

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800
Why?

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.160
Do you want to film it with him instead?

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.920
I'm sorry that it seems like
I'm stealing your thunder

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.640
just because I'm in your body.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.920
If you want to be in the vlog
or talk to Auer,

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.920
why don't we
find a way to switch back now?

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.480
If that's all you came here for,

00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:08.640
can you please leave?

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:11.280
I'm preparing for the next scene,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.360
so I need to be focused.

00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:37.040
Print, why were you
so sarcastic to her?!

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.240
That was pretty obvious...

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:53.720
You like Auer, don't you?

00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.000
This is the scene where Auer
is torn between choosing the two girls;

00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.480
meanwhile, both Rey and Print
will beg Auer

00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:07.800
for his love.

00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:09.440
Okay, that's about it.

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:11.160
- Alright, we're ready.
- Let's go.

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:12.200
Be on standby...

00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.960
Ready...

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:14.760
Camera rolling...

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.640
and action!

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.240
Didn't you say I was the only woman

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.040
you wished to spend your life with?

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.800
Does your heart still hold true,
Mr. Prachak?

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:38.520
I can't answer that.

00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.000
I'm dearly sorry.

00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.920
Please just speak the truth,

00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.280
and stop showering me with false hope.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:51.880
Mr. Prachak...

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.200
what would you decide?

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:57.840
Please answer me!

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000
Mr. Prachak!

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:00.960
Mr. Prachak,

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:08.560
I could never understand
why you're so fickle.

00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:11.800
If you want to love,
you need to make yourself clear at once

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.200
instead of making two women
wait for you to decide!

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:21.360
This is not what gentlemen do.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.240
Cut!

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.600
Print, go wait for the next scene.

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:31.120
Yes, sir.

00:17:32.440 --> 00:17:35.680
Pong, I'm truly sorry.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.600
What were you thinking?

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.920
I freaking love that!

00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:46.960
I'll take it!

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:49.360
It's such a woke move.

00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.360
So woke.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.920
That's just...
a wonderful job.

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:54.800
Guys, give her a round of applause!

00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:56.920
Let's move the set!

00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:58.560
Top-notch!

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.040
Rey,

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:03.600
can I talk to you for a sec?

00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.440
About how I went off the script?

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:09.280
- I'm really sorry...
- No, not about that.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600
I...

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.360
I wanna ask you out for a meal.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.680
Do you have any time to spare?

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:25.960
My schedule is pretty packed right now.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.160
Um...

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:34.640
I really have something
important to tell you.

00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.280
Tell me when you have time, please?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.400
Okay?

00:18:59.240 --> 00:18:59.880
Fon!

00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:01.520
What?

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.760
What does it mean when a guy

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:06.800
invites a girl to a meal?

00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:09.880
Why do you ask?

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.320
Is somebody asking you on a date?

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.080
No! It's just research

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.800
for a scene

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.680
where a guy invites my character out
for a meal.

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.120
Hm... Actually...

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.640
It could mean one of the two things...

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:28.480
Maybe he really wants
to take you on a date,

00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:31.480
or maybe it's genuinely a platonic meal

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.040
to discuss something.

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.760
This is just a what-if.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:39.360
Ah...

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:42.560
- Let's say that A is a friend of B...
- Mm.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.720
yet A is possessive of B.

00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.400
Is A in the wrong?

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.400
But you don't feel "possessive"
toward a friend.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:57.280
Alright, alright.

00:19:57.720 --> 00:19:59.960
Well, it's not entirely wrong...

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.360
It's just two people
feeling something different.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.840
One thinks of another
more than friends,

00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:08.840
while the other
thinks of them as a friend.

00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.560
But who could help it?

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:14.000
Feelings are impossible to control.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.160
What if...

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.640
Alright. "What if."

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.680
What if B was asked out,

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.160
- but A didn't want them to go,
- Hm.

00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:28.720
would it be wrong?

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.080
Would that be wrong?

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880
Hm...

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.960
I guess it's up to B
if they wanted to go.

00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.080
If B did,

00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:41.720
A wouldn't be able
to say anything, right?

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.080
I think you'd better...

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:48.560
A!

00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:56.960
I think A'd better be honest with B

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.320
and talk things out.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.520
Alright!

00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.520
I'll pass the message to A.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:09.520
It was just a what-if...

00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:11.440
- Right...
- Just a what-if...

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:23.640
I'll blow-dry your hair.

00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.840
What if my body got sick
because you let it air dry?

00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.680
Mm...

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.960
Sit right there.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:52.920
My body is too tall,

00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:55.120
while yours is short...

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.200
Could you sit there instead?

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:58.640
In the Jacuzzi.

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:02.680
Mm.

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920
How bossy!

00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:17.520
Dyfun,

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.000
a blow dryer from your dream.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.560
I have something to ask you.

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.160
I have something to ask you!

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.440
Huh? What was that?

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:39.600
I have something to ask you!

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:41.320
I do, too!

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.880
- Are you in love with Auer?
- Are you in love with Auer?

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:48.440
- I'm not!
- Are you outta your mind?!

00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:55.640
Why would you think
I'm in love with him?

00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:57.920
Well...

00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.200
You guys seem close,

00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:02.720
and you even saved
his contact name with an emoji.

00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:05.200
Saving someone's contact name
with an emoji

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.440
should mean something special?

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:11.560
And...

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.240
why do you think I'm into him?

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.640
It seems like
you're having a crush on someone,

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:25.520
and Auer is the only one
you're particularly close to right now.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.880
Nuh-uh!

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:28.440
I never even want to be!

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:31.440
That guy's the one trying to get close.

00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:35.560
Auer and I are friends;

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.840
there's no way
we could be something else.

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:41.520
What if...

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.080
Auer asked you to be his girlfriend?

00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.280
I would reject him.

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:50.000
What?

00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:52.000
What about my hair?

00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:52.880
I'm sleepy!

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:05.440
[Auer]

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.440
About your invite...

00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:10.080
how about lunch tomorrow?

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.960
I have your favorite dish
ordered right here.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.680
Lemme help you with some.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.880
Don't bother.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120
I'll do it myself.

00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:39.400
If there's something you want to say,

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.080
just shoot it straight.

00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.400
I have somewhere to be next.

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.600
Do you think this is pretty?

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:59.000
I think I'll give this to someone,

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.480
but I'm not sure if they will like it.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.480
I spent a lot of time choosing

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.120
and guessing what they like.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.600
- Maybe they'd...
- Auer,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.120
I'm sorry,

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:12.760
but I only think of you as a friend.

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.440
Do you think
I think of you more than friends?

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.920
Well, you...

00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.280
You asked me out for a meal
and showed me that necklace,

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.000
so I thought... this was a date.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.960
Don't tell me...

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.360
you thought I liked you, Rey?

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.320
The reason I asked you to join me today

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.920
is that I really wanna ask
for your advice.

00:25:42.640 --> 00:25:44.400
Here's what happened...

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.560
I'm seeing someone

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.560
who's not in the industry.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.400
I'm thinking about
committing to the relationship.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.040
Who is that person?

00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.880
And how did you two meet?

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.760
He's my junior from college

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.080
who is now working on our set.

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.240
For real?!

00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:07.160
Being on the same set,

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:09.760
I invited him to stay over at my place

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:11.760
to make it easier to travel to work,

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:13.360
when, in fact,

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.840
I just want some time alone with him.

00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:18.600
At first,

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.760
he wasn't gonna come live with me

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.480
because he was worried about

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.720
his older sister living alone.

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.240
But, ultimately,

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:29.560
it turned out his sister
went to live with a friend,

00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.160
so he agreed.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:35.280
Wait...

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.480
What position is
the person you're seeing

00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:40.920
responsible for on the set?

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:43.040
He's in the art team.

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.000
Don't tell me it's Frank?!

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:48.280
Please take off your masks.

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.400
I've been so busy
with the internship.

00:26:55.760 --> 00:26:57.560
Can I go live with my friend
for a while?

00:26:57.600 --> 00:26:59.000
It's easier to go to work from there.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.120
This is for me?

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520
Yes!!

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.080
Oh, so you can tell?

00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:16.520
I'm thinking about asking Frank
to be my boyfriend with this bracelet.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:19.240
At first, I was gonna get us
matching rings,

00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.440
but since I'm an actor,

00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:22.720
the paparazzi could catch on to that.

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.960
So, bracelet it is.

00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:25.840
Isn't it nice?

00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.880
"Nice" my ass!

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.600
What...

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.840
Does Frank not like bracelets
or something?

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:32.080
It's not like that...

00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.560
Be for real with me,

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:34.800
do you really love Frank?

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.920
Have you really thought this through?

00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:38.400
You're an actor;

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.840
what do you have planned for the future?

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:42.120
Are you gonna keep it a secret forever?!

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:42.840
Huh?!

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:45.880
You...

00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:48.840
You talk like you're Frank's sister...

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.520
Just think it over, Auer!

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:01.920
Rey!

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.320
I know now Auer doesn't like you

00:28:05.360 --> 00:28:06.760
or me!

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.400
And who's he into?

00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:10.680
Frank!

00:28:10.720 --> 00:28:12.640
Auer is in a talking stage with Frank!

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.960
And he's gonna ask Frank
to be his boyfriend!

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.920
I'd love to see Auer in a relationship.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.440
He must be falling head over heels!

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:32.280
Hey, hey!

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:34.000
The door's jammed,
so just leave it like that.

00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:36.240
If it's closed, it won't open
from the inside.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.920
- Thanks!
- That was close.

00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:47.080
- Boo!
- Gosh!

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.520
You scared me!

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.880
Stop playing!

00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:51.920
The doll could break, you know?

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:54.600
Are you free tonight?

00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:55.680
Let's have dinner together.

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.000
What's the occasion?

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:13.040
I'll just shoot it straight.

00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:15.360
Are you asking Frank
to be your boyfriend today?

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.240
Thanks to you asking that day,

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:24.720
I went home and pondered

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:26.880
before deciding that...

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:30.400
no matter what happens,
I want Frank by my side.

00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:46.960
What if Frank got a backlash like I did?

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.960
Could you bear to see it happen?

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.040
Don't you feel bad for him?

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:17.160
It smells like someone's in love,
don't you think?

00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.400
What's up with you, Sis?

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.560
Are you rehearsing or something?

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.520
You can talk to me, you know?

00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.000
I want to be an older sister

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.840
who gives advice to her brother
on lovey-dovey stuff.

00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.240
I've been seeing someone lately,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.480
but I don't think
we can be more than this.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:45.640
There's no chance...

00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.000
between us.

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.240
Frank...

00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:52.800
listen carefully.

00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.600
There's a chance.

00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:56.560
All that matters is;

00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.920
first, you truly love them.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:00.680
And second...

00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.720
that person is sincere with you.

00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:05.440
If these two things are present,

00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480
then just go for it.

00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:08.520
I will be your supporter,

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:10.760
no matter who that person might be.

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.920
Okay?

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.920
Aww, thank you so much, Sis.

00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:19.760
Well said!

00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:22.480
Print, Frank,

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:23.800
I brought some orange juice.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:28.640
Thank you, Auer!

00:31:29.320 --> 00:31:30.920
That's so thoughtful of you.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:34.040
Anyone would be lucky...

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
to have you as their boyfriend.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.320
Um...

00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.880
Frank and I are
going to have dinner together.

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.080
Do you wanna join?

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.760
It's alright. You guys enjoy yourselves.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:54.600
My brother is a big boy now,

00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:57.440
no need for me to chaperone,

00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:58.720
right?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.800
What are you even saying?

00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.040
Maybe I've grown just a bit.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:10.440
Let the fake sister be the matchmaker.

00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.720
I, the real sister,
shall be the rain on their parade!

00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.000
I'm sorry, Frank...

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:39.200
Meet me at the prop room ASAP.

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.560
Don't bring anyone else, Frank.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.040
Shit!

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.360
Frank...

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.040
we need to talk.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.000
Hey...

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:52.800
How did you get here?!

00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:55.440
Sis!

00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.080
So the doll's all ruined?!

00:32:58.520 --> 00:32:59.520
What doll?

00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:02.880
Well, the doll you texted me about!

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.160
Here.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.960
I will handle this.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.080
- Huh?
- Don't you have plans with Auer?

00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.560
Just run along.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.480
Go.

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.760
How nice it is to be in your body.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280
Only for you!

00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.400
Not for me

00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:38.200
who has to be stuck
in such a tiny body!

00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.040
Hey, watch your language.

00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:50.200
Don't you forget
that I'm the master of my own body!

00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:53.480
Come here!

00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:55.320
Print, stop!

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.080
I said stop!

00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:00.600
My weakness...

00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:01.800
- Print!
- is my waist!

00:34:01.880 --> 00:34:03.400
Ow, knock it off!

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.480
Why won't it open?

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:18.280
The door's jammed!

00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:20.480
No!

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:21.960
Don't tell me...

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:24.600
I have to be stuck here with you.

00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:29.160
Hello!

00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.560
Is there anyone outside?

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.040
Is there anyone out there?

00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:35.880
Could you come open the door for us?

00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:37.520
No...

00:34:39.440 --> 00:34:41.040
Is there anyone out there?

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000
I think they all went home.

00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.120
There's no signal in here at all!

00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:51.520
Gosh,

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.640
is this really the time
to run out of battery?

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.520
Do you have your phone?

00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.480
Oh...

00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.840
I may have left it in the room.

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.000
I guess we'll have to wait

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.480
until Fon and Mai come look for us.

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.240
Now, I can't stop Auer and Frank
from being together!

00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.480
Hey,

00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:22.800
are you serious?

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.400
You're really gonna
mess with their relationship?

00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:26.920
Yep,

00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.720
if those two get together,

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.080
I'll tell Frank to break up with Auer.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.240
You're acting like
an evil mother-in-law,

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:38.920
do you realize that?

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:22.880
Here,

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:25.520
please take a seat, Miss Rey.

00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.160
Thanks.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:39.960
Let me ask you this.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.760
Is the only reason
you don't want Frank to date Auer

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.280
because...

00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.320
you're concerned
about him dating a celeb?

00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:56.960
Seeing how a famous actress like you
got so much hate

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:00.040
after getting shipped with Auer…

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.360
I couldn't imagine
what an ordinary person like Frank

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.760
would have to go through.

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.520
I don't want my loved ones
to ever experience that.

00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.520
Mm...

00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.840
I understand

00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.160
that you care about your brother.

00:37:29.600 --> 00:37:31.160
But do you really think

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:33.880
you can forbid their love?

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:41.920
Think of it this way;

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.120
when you're in love with someone,

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.400
you can't even stop yourself

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:50.160
from staring at them.

00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.640
The more you try not to think of them,

00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.080
the more you fail.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.840
Do you really think

00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.520
you can forbid your heart from loving?

00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:20.680
No...

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.680
I really can't...

00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.320
Sis!

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.240
Frank, why are you here?!

00:38:37.680 --> 00:38:38.800
Don't you have somewhere to be?

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:40.720
It...

00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:44.640
It just bothered me
leaving my sister to handle it alone,

00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.240
even though I should be
the one responsible.

00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:50.240
So I went to find materials
to fix the doll.

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:57.280
But...that would mean...

00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.040
Auer is alone at the restaurant?

00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:03.040
You're right. I haven't called him...

00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:07.160
It's fine, Sis.

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:08.600
It's just a meal.

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.440
I can reschedule it.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.480
You can't!

00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:11.840
Screw that doll.

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.920
We'll take care of it.

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.680
Go find Auer right now!

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.880
Auer!

00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.440
I'm so sorry...

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.800
Please don't be mad at me.

00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:43.640
I thought I had to throw away
this beautiful occasion.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.920
This beautiful occasion?

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:12.280
I don't know how long this will last,

00:40:14.720 --> 00:40:16.240
but I can say for certain

00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:18.680
that I want to
make our relationship public.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.760
But you do realize

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.720
that if we do,

00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.880
there will be those who are supportive

00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:33.120
and those against us, right?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:39.880
However, I promise

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:42.320
that I will hold on tightly
to your hand

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:44.840
while we walk through this path.

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.920
Will you be my boyfriend?

00:40:58.320 --> 00:40:59.120
Mm!

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.080
Your bracelet.

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:09.160
Thank you.

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.960
That's more like
the big sister of the family.

00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:33.280
Just you wait, if Auer ever hurts Frank,

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:35.760
I'll make sure
I'm Auer's No. 1 anti-fan.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.880
You'll see.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:38.600
Is that so?

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.040
Would you do that?

00:41:44.920 --> 00:41:47.360
Don't you just wish
you could meet your true love?

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400
Well...

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:55.800
have you come across one?

00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.360
True love?

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:01.200
No.

00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:03.120
Apart from working...

00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:04.680
what time do you think I have?

00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:15.840
Well, do you know...

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.520
what true love looks like?

00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:21.120
Hm...

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:23.520
For me?

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:28.200
I like someone
who's good at taking care of others...

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:30.760
thinking on their feet...

00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:32.880
and...

00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.440
someone who loves their family.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:47.800
Hey,

00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:50.640
what about you?
What's your idea of true love?

00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.920
Not spilling it!

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:55.440
What?

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.680
That's cheating!

00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.280
I already told you mine!

00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:01.040
Nothing I can do 'bout that

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.600
since you chose to say it.

00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:08.160
You better hope I never find out

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.760
because I'll be taunting you
all day and night!

00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:30.240
- Mai,
- Hm?

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.800
can I talk to you about something?

00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:33.640
Mm, go on.

00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:37.800
About the vlog that I do with Rey...

00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:38.760
Uh-huh.

00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:40.840
I don't want it
to focus on the ship anymore.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:42.440
I want to respect my boyfriend.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.720
I can understand that,

00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:50.160
but it's not possible to just stop

00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:53.920
since this has been agreed
with the sponsor.

00:43:57.520 --> 00:43:58.960
How about this, Auer?

00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:01.800
Just switch the show a little

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.200
into you interviewing the people on set.

00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:07.960
I think the audience will love
seeing the set with you in it.

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:10.960
That's a good idea, Fon.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Thank you so much.

00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.000
Of course.

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.320
I guess we can't help it.

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.480
Feelings are impossible to stop,
aren't they?

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:31.280
You'll realize soon enough

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.920
once you're more experienced.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.320
That quote must be
from the 18th century.

00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:48.480
Does your heart still hold true,
Mr. Prachak?

00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:49.720
Auer,

00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:54.120
I'm sorry I wasn't supportive
of you and Frank earlier.

00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.120
It's all good.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:00.320
I understand
that you're worried about us both.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:05.600
I guess when you fall madly in love,

00:45:06.440 --> 00:45:07.720
you'll understand us.

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.560
Shut up!

00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160
You've got a crush?!

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:23.880
Shush!

00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:25.800
Keep it down!

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:28.640
Who is it?

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.680
Can you tell me?

00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:31.560
Think of it as a trade.

00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.360
Swear you won't tell anyone this!

00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:41.040
Alright.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:42.240
We are our only friends;

00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:43.280
who else would I tell?

00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:53.040
The person I have a crush on...

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.520
is...

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:09.800
Print.
