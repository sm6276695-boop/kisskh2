00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:11.879
I once read a

00:01:11.879 --> 00:01:13.159
classic feminist novel.

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:15.359
I really liked the way the heroine was portrayed.

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.040
I also liked the core of the story.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.959
Only two independent souls

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:21.640
are truly worthy of love.

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:24.439
I've read the novel you mentioned.

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.560
But I have a completely different perspective.

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:28.760
From the story's point of view,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.719
it is indeed a romance novel.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.959
But from the heroine's perspective,

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.040
it's actually a horror story.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:38.959
From the author's viewpoint,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.920
we can see

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.400
the male lead's struggle in marriage.

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:42.760
This marriage

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
brought both physical and emotional

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.719
pain to the male lead.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.719
It's a personal

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.239
and a tragedy of our times.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.079
I agree with your view.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:52.439
However,

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.599
when it comes to this

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.480
marriage doomed to fail,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.439
both of them are victims.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.359
The male lead has forever lost

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:02.120
the chance to see the world again.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.920
And his wife has lost even moreâ€”everything.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.879
I hope such tragedies never happen again.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.439
You two,

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.080
why don't you come up and share?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.360
I'll take a break.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.039
Xu Xin's presentation was quite good.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.599
So how can we

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:23.240
avoid such tragedies?

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.520
The simplest way

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.479
is to learn from the classics.

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:32.840
So how do we learn those lessons?

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.759
First, we need to pay attention in class.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.400
People often chase power, wealth, and fame.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:48.639
But the heroine

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.960
taught me a different set of values.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.840
Come, take a look here.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.159
Don't fall for someone casually.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.560
What are you talking about?

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.120
I bet you're thinking right now,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.960
what zodiac sign is Teacher Zhong?

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:04.439
Is he a Scorpio or an Aquarius?

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:05.879
That's not what I'm thinking.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.599
Go back and read the book carefully.

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:11.319
Hi there.

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.360
Can I talk to you for a moment?

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.879
Thank you, Teacher Zhong. I'll leave now.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.919
Xu Xin.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.879
Good morning.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.479
Do you know me?

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:29.919
See you later, Xu Xin.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.120
What's wrong?

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:50.680
Xixi.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.879
Xinxin.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.520
I have something to tell you.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.560
What's up?

00:03:57.159 --> 00:03:58.840
After art history class just now,

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.000
Chen Fei confessed to me.

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.439
Chen Fei?

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:06.719
The one who dated the journalism department's beauty?

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:07.960
That Chen Fei who was in a relationship?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.159
I remember she got depressed

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.159
and then dropped out, right?

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.840
He explained it to me.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.039
He said

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:17.160
that girl's mental state

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:18.519
wasn't good to begin with.

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.240
Of course he'd say that.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.399
Xiao Yi,

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.279
the main thing is whether you like him.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:29.879
I'm not sure.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.360
Then wait until you're sure.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.839
I remember you told me

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.360
you hadn't really dated before college.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.399
So you should be careful when it comes to relationships.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.959
You're our best friend.

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:44.959
We can't just watch you walk into danger.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.120
I'll think it over carefully.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:25.920
Sorry,

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.199
for taking a few minutes of your time.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.560
I'm a student from the architecture department.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.560
My name is Chen Fei.

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:35.480
Today, I want to confess my feelings to the girl I love.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.240
I hope everyone here

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:38.759
can be my witness.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:41.279
Xiao Yi,

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.319
from the moment I first saw you,

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.519
I fell deeply in love with you.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.160
Please give me a chance

00:05:48.959 --> 00:05:50.000
to love you wholeheartedly.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
Be my girlfriend.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:03.399
Be together! Be together! Be together!

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.639
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.920
Xixi, let's go check that out.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:20.879
Sure!

00:06:58.519 --> 00:07:00.839
Why does this girl look so much like you?

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:02.160
It's not just similar.

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:03.759
That's actually me.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.360
Lu Ming.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.240
I remember now.

00:07:09.759 --> 00:07:11.879
He's the guy from Professor Zhong's class

00:07:11.879 --> 00:07:13.480
who discussed novels with you.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.879
Do you both know him?

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.920
He's a top student at the art academy.

00:07:17.079 --> 00:07:18.240
He won several design awards

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.519
even before graduating.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.759
You're the only one who didn't know.

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:21.759
Hey, classmate.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.800
Your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.360
Yes.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:27.720
Do you realize what you did is illegal?

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.319
Sorry about that.

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.279
I emailed you before.

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:33.720
But you never replied.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.319
This assignment was urgent.

00:07:35.439 --> 00:07:36.199
So I...

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:37.480
What email?

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.399
Even if you sent an email,

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:47.519
without my permission,

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:49.519
it's still a violation of my portrait rights.

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:52.079
Sorry.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.079
I sincerely apologize to you here.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:56.680
I'm sorry.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.120
Is an apology all?

00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:01.720
Shouldn't you at least treat me to a meal?

00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.160
I don't know what you like to eat,

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:07.000
so I ordered three signature dishes from this place.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.399
So why did you put me

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.639
in your artwork?

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:12.439
My teacher told me

00:08:13.279 --> 00:08:15.639
art should follow your heart.

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:17.720
The first time I saw you,

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.399
I was drawn to you without even realizing it.

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:25.319
Excuse me.

00:08:25.319 --> 00:08:26.120
Let me take this call.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:29.720
Hello?

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:30.680
Xu Xin.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:31.319
Where are you?

00:08:31.319 --> 00:08:31.959
Something happened.

00:08:32.399 --> 00:08:33.240
What happened?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.200
Don't ask.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.720
Come back quickly.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:35.879
Someone got hurt.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.879
Sorry, I have an emergency.

00:08:39.879 --> 00:08:40.559
I have to go.

00:08:40.919 --> 00:08:41.759
Let's talk next time.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000
What exactly happened?

00:08:50.679 --> 00:08:51.960
That bastard hit Xiao Yi.

00:08:52.039 --> 00:08:52.879
It's not like that.

00:08:52.879 --> 00:08:53.960
Let me explain.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:55.519
Xiao Yi.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.200
I'm sorry.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.639
I really didn't mean to.

00:09:00.279 --> 00:09:01.639
I just love you too much.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:02.679
That's why I thought

00:09:02.679 --> 00:09:04.320
you had something going on with that jerk.

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.799
I just wanted to check your phone.

00:09:05.799 --> 00:09:06.799
But you wouldn't let me.

00:09:06.919 --> 00:09:08.159
That's why I didn't trust you.

00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:09.559
I'm worse than an animal.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.120
Bastard.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.440
Stay away from me from now on.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:15.519
Xiao Yi.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:17.000
Ignore this jerk, let's go.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.399
Xiao Yi, Xiao Yi!

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.360
I promise I won't hurt you again.

00:09:26.879 --> 00:09:30.360
Hurting you hurts me ten thousand times more.

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.639
Chen Fei, what are you doing?

00:09:32.639 --> 00:09:33.399
Don't be impulsive.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.039
Don't do this, let me go.

00:09:36.039 --> 00:09:36.600
Chen Fei.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:37.600
Let me go.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.200
Xu Xin.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.600
Come with me for a moment.

00:10:09.159 --> 00:10:10.039
Okay, teacher.

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.000
Xu Xin.

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.320
Do you remember the day

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.559
when Teacher Liao came to see your performance?

00:10:15.159 --> 00:10:17.159
Out of so many people, he noticed you right away.

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:19.879
It's a rare chance to intern with their dance troupe.

00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:22.240
If you do well, you might even study abroad.

00:10:22.759 --> 00:10:23.519
What do you think?

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:24.919
Am I dreaming?

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.879
Of course I want to go for this opportunity.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.320
Xu Xin.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.200
Are you sure you still want to teach kids part-time?

00:10:46.639 --> 00:10:48.159
Don't worry, Teacher Zhou.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.240
I won't let it affect my work with the troupe.

00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:52.720
Besides, I like kids.

00:11:00.159 --> 00:11:00.879
Teacher Xu.

00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:02.279
Do you know this person?

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.440
We went to the same university.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:07.639
But we're not close.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:31.240
Hello.

00:11:31.639 --> 00:11:32.360
Do you need any help?

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.440
This book isn't actually that great.

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.679
If you just skim through it,

00:11:46.679 --> 00:11:47.799
and decide to buy it,

00:11:48.519 --> 00:11:49.919
it would be a waste of your money.

00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.840
Do you have any mystery novels here?

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840
I do have one to recommend.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:04.840
Klein's Kettle.

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.759
What's the book about?

00:12:08.639 --> 00:12:09.240
Have you

00:12:10.279 --> 00:12:11.720
ever doubted if this world

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:12.759
might actually be fake?

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.639
What do you mean?

00:12:17.279 --> 00:12:19.320
I mean the plot of the novel.

00:12:22.279 --> 00:12:23.639
In mathematics,

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:26.000
a Klein's Kettle is a non-orientable surface.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.120
It can only truly exist

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:29.600
in four-dimensional space.

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:32.360
At first, the story seems

00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:34.639
to take place in the real world.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.960
But as the plot deepens and splits,

00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.320
it ends up creating several similar

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:42.399
but different twin realities.

00:12:42.799 --> 00:12:44.519
People can't tell where the beginning is

00:12:44.519 --> 00:12:45.440
or where the end is.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.360
Those trapped inside

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:49.080
can only judge by death

00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.919
whether the end is the beginning

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.559
or the real end.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.960
But even so,

00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.840
can you really start at the beginning

00:12:58.440 --> 00:12:59.919
and end at the end?

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.240
Hope you like it.

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:14.519
Thank you.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.200
Are you a dancer?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.399
How did you know I study dance?

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.440
Sorry,

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.279
I saw it by accident.

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:23.799
Yeah.

00:13:24.679 --> 00:13:26.200
But I'm not a dancer yet.

00:13:26.559 --> 00:13:27.639
I'm just a performer.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:29.879
I'm still working towards becoming a dancer.

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.279
That's impressive.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:33.240
To become a professional dancer,

00:13:33.799 --> 00:13:35.200
you must have sacrificed a lot.

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.559
I really have given up quite a bit.

00:13:39.399 --> 00:13:41.799
But the outcome isn't as great as I hoped.

00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.399
Actually, the result doesn't matter.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.919
Start at the beginning,

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:50.600
end at the end.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.080
That's enough.

00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:55.759
That's what the book says.

00:13:59.799 --> 00:14:00.919
I'll read it carefully.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.360
By the way,

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.200
I'm Xu Xin.

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.279
I'm Song Jianping.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:06.919
You can call me Aping.

00:14:06.919 --> 00:14:07.960
Nice to meet you too.

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:09.600
I think

00:14:09.799 --> 00:14:10.720
I should head back.

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:13.720
Xu Xin,

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.840
reality isn't always disappointing.

00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.919
Sometimes, surprises come too.

00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:04.320
Hey, Xu Xin,

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:06.360
I've heard you talk about your boyfriend for so long,

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.679
but this is my first time meeting him.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:09.919
Xu Xin has mentioned you to me several times too.

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:12.279
I heard you two were really close in college.

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.279
Isn't there someone else?

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.080
Oh right, where's Xixi?

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.159
I don't know.

00:15:17.159 --> 00:15:18.720
I just called her.

00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.519
She should be here soon.

00:15:22.639 --> 00:15:23.519
By the way, Chen Fei,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:25.120
how's work going lately?

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.799
What can I say?

00:15:26.879 --> 00:15:27.720
It's just the usual.

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.120
Drawing every day.

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.960
Just a regular worker.

00:15:31.039 --> 00:15:31.639
Oh yeah,

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.200
another friend is coming soon.

00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.320
He was in my department in college.

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.159
His name is Lu Ming.

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.440
Iâ€™m not sure if you know him.

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:38.200
Yeah,

00:15:38.279 --> 00:15:39.320
back in our college days,

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:40.440
he was that really famous senior.

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.399
Do you remember?

00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:43.000
I kind of remember.

00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:44.799
Sorry,

00:15:44.799 --> 00:15:45.519
I'm late.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.200
Busy person, huh?

00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:48.799
Have a seat.

00:15:50.159 --> 00:15:51.159
Let me introduce you.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:53.639
This is my wife, Xiao Yi.

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:54.519
You've met her before.

00:15:54.679 --> 00:15:55.080
Hello.

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:56.399
This is her college friend,

00:15:56.399 --> 00:15:56.960
Xu Xin,

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.480
and her boyfriend, Song Jianping.

00:15:58.679 --> 00:15:59.480
Hello.

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.600
I remember you.

00:16:02.039 --> 00:16:03.080
I remember back in college,

00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.519
we took Western Literature History together.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:06.279
Was it Professor Zhong's class?

00:16:07.159 --> 00:16:08.679
Professor Zhong's class was really interesting.

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:10.879
Are you still in touch with him?

00:16:11.519 --> 00:16:12.399
How's he doing lately?

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:13.559
You don't know?

00:16:14.399 --> 00:16:15.519
A few years after we graduated,

00:16:15.679 --> 00:16:17.559
he was reported for sexual harassment by a junior.

00:16:17.759 --> 00:16:18.679
He was expelled from the university.

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.720
I haven't heard anything about him in ages.

00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:25.600
Sorry I'm late.

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:26.879
Everyone's here.

00:16:27.159 --> 00:16:28.080
You finally made it.

00:16:29.279 --> 00:16:29.799
Alright.

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.519
Everyone's here now.

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.120
Let's raise a glass.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:32.919
Come on.

00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:34.679
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.600
So, what does your boyfriend do?

00:16:41.879 --> 00:16:43.600
Jianping owns a small book cafÃ©.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:45.480
We met at his shop.

00:16:46.279 --> 00:16:46.799
Yeah.

00:16:46.799 --> 00:16:49.360
Back then, I recommended a mystery novel to Xu Xin.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:50.399
Klein's Kettle.

00:16:52.919 --> 00:16:54.159
I remember in college,

00:16:54.159 --> 00:16:55.159
you really liked literary history.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:57.360
You even said you wanted to write novels someday.

00:16:58.919 --> 00:17:00.320
Xu Xin is writing one now.

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:02.480
Really?

00:17:02.679 --> 00:17:03.840
What kind of novel is it?

00:17:05.079 --> 00:17:05.880
A suspense novel.

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.480
But it's just for fun.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.319
I think you write really well.

00:17:09.519 --> 00:17:12.240
They say history is fake,

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:13.599
but novels are the real thing.

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.119
Did you put us in your story?

00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.920
I'll tell you when it's finished.

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.240
Then I have a suggestion for you.

00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:22.839
Let Lu Ming design the cover.

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:25.279
His hands turn everything into gold these days.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.480
Any collaboration with him

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:28.680
sells like crazy.

00:17:30.559 --> 00:17:31.359
By the way, Lu Ming,

00:17:32.079 --> 00:17:33.960
now that you're so successful,

00:17:34.799 --> 00:17:36.319
haven't you thought about your personal life?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.079
I haven't considered it yet.

00:17:38.359 --> 00:17:40.480
What's there to consider?

00:17:40.599 --> 00:17:41.720
When it comes to men and women,

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:42.599
it's just a matter of attraction.

00:17:43.759 --> 00:17:45.640
Isn't there another single person right next to you?

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.240
If you're both single, you should get together.

00:17:51.519 --> 00:17:53.000
I think you two are a good match.

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:54.720
Xixi,

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:56.039
no offense,

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:57.559
but you're not that young anymore.

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.359
Look at your two friends here,

00:17:59.799 --> 00:18:01.400
they're both in relationships.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.000
If you don't find a boyfriend soon,

00:18:03.160 --> 00:18:03.920
in a few years,

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.480
you might end up as an unmarried woman.

00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.079
No need, really.

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:08.720
I'm happy being single.

00:18:09.759 --> 00:18:12.240
What if I end up with another unreliable guy?

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.440
Maybe he doesn't even make much money.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.599
I'd have to support him.

00:18:17.319 --> 00:18:19.839
Maybe he talks nonsense all the time.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.720
What if he hits women when he's upset?

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:33.559
Xixi,

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.839
what do you mean by that?

00:18:39.359 --> 00:18:39.960
Fair point.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:43.319
Lu Ming, let me give you some advice.

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.559
Be careful when choosing a woman.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:48.640
Don't pick someone who's always frowning.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.000
Or someone who gossips nonstop.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.640
And always exaggerates everything.

00:18:54.599 --> 00:18:55.319
Sorry.

00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:57.079
Looks like I killed the mood.

00:19:00.119 --> 00:19:00.839
I'll finish this bottle.

00:19:01.279 --> 00:19:01.880
I'm leaving.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.039
So I'm drinking alone?

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:16.480
You're not joining me?

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.640
Come on, be a sport.

00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:34.599
I'll get you for this!

00:19:35.119 --> 00:19:36.599
Chen Fei, Chen Fei, are you crazy?

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.200
Just wait, I'm not done with you!

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.559
Calm down, don't pull me.

00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:40.880
I'm fine.

00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.079
Xiaoyi,

00:19:56.279 --> 00:19:58.079
I didn't ask you to do all this.

00:19:59.119 --> 00:20:00.279
If I don't, who will?

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:01.440
Xu Xin?

00:20:03.559 --> 00:20:04.400
Xiaoyi,

00:20:04.839 --> 00:20:06.319
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

00:20:11.759 --> 00:20:12.480
Sorry.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:15.920
It's all my fault.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.000
I ruined our reunion.

00:20:20.799 --> 00:20:21.640
But Xiaoyi,

00:20:24.119 --> 00:20:26.559
I've been advising you since college.

00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:28.119
But I know you won't listen.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.240
Let's leave it at that.

00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:41.799
Xu Xin,

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:45.640
when your book is done, send me a copy.

00:20:46.599 --> 00:20:47.960
I'll be your first reader.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:50.880
I'm off.

00:21:09.279 --> 00:21:10.880
I really miss the three of us.

00:21:12.079 --> 00:21:13.359
Doing nothing,

00:21:13.519 --> 00:21:15.079
just chatting like this.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.039
After we graduated from college,

00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:18.759
these chances became rare.

00:21:19.039 --> 00:21:19.720
Yeah.

00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:22.039
After Xiao Yi got married,

00:21:22.519 --> 00:21:23.920
she barely kept in touch with us.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:25.680
What are you talking about?

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:28.039
Xiao Yi got married?

00:21:29.799 --> 00:21:30.480
Yeah.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.960
She married Chen Fei right after graduation.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.440
Chen Fei?

00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:37.759
You weren't there that day.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:39.279
Chen Fei scratched me.

00:21:39.279 --> 00:21:41.039
Xiao Yi broke up with him on the spot.

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.160
Xi Xi.

00:21:43.079 --> 00:21:45.119
It's completely over between us.

00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.240
Xiao Yi.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.599
I wasn't there?

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.759
Didn't we just have dinner together a few days ago?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.119
You even had a conflict with Chen Fei then.

00:21:54.559 --> 00:21:57.160
I haven't seen him since graduation.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.519
Xu Xin.

00:22:00.599 --> 00:22:01.480
What's wrong?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.960
So where is Xiao Yi now?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:21.119
We...

00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:24.319
Why are we even here?

00:22:33.079 --> 00:22:34.160
Hello, Jianping.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:36.359
I'll be back later.

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:39.039
I'm buying you a gift.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:42.160
You'll know when I get back.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:43.960
Bye.
