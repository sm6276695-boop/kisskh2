00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:38.000
How do you open this?

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:39.280
Try it carefully.

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.040
There are many things

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.879
that only have meaning if you discover them yourself.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.479
Do you like it?

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.319
Is this a swallowtail butterfly?

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.400
Yes.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.719
But this box is so complicated.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:24.240
Don’t you think it’s interesting?

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.039
It’s like the human heart.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:29.039
Full of hidden mechanisms and secret paths.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:36.400
But these things

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.599
all happened in situations I don’t understand.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.840
When the brain is extremely tired,

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.840
it can cause memory confusion.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.319
Now I can hardly tell

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:50.159
what’s real

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.039
and what’s not.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.439
It’s as if these people

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.199
never even

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.840
existed in this world.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.800
Ms. Xu,

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.520
I’m a doctor.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:02.719
Maybe I shouldn’t say this,

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:03.879
but I once

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.520
heard a theory.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.520
It’s quite interesting.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.840
Would you like to hear it?

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.159
It’s the parallel universe theory.

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:16.039
Some say there are many parallel universes in this world.

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.960
And they all exist independently.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.080
They’re very similar,

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:23.520
but at certain key moments,

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:27.039
small differences happen because of different events.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.520
For example,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.639
if the me in a parallel universe

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.439
didn’t choose to be a counselor,

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.800
then the person sitting across from you there

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.240
would be someone else.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.439
Maybe in another universe, you

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.039
did something different,

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.840
and now you happen to see that scene.

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.560
That could cause memory confusion.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.080
Of course, these theories

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:58.960
aren’t scientifically proven.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.360
Ms. Xu,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.639
what about you?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.560
The most important thing now is to relax.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.639
Let go of your guard against everyone.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.199
Then, follow my treatment.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.719
We’ll take it step by step.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.639
I believe you’ll get better.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.839
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.360
Xu Xin.

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:45.480
It’s getting late.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.199
You should go home and rest.

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:50.079
Lu Ming.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.680
I’m afraid I’ll never get better.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.720
Don’t say that. Don’t scare yourself.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.680
But I’m really not doing well right now.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:09.079
I don’t even know what I’ll see next.

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:11.839
What I see—

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:14.759
is it really real?

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.040
Are we,

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.040
and everything in this room,

00:05:25.079 --> 00:05:26.720
all actually real?

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:31.480
Or

00:05:33.519 --> 00:05:34.720
am I still dreaming?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.519
I just want to wake up soon.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.120
Xu Xin.

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.800
You’re too tense right now.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.680
You’re wound too tight.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.319
I called your mom.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.120
I’ll take you to see her tomorrow.

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:58.040
But my mom, she—

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.600
It’s okay.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160
Dr. Xu said

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.160
you should see your family more.

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:08.040
It’ll help your recovery.

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.600
Nothing else matters to me.

00:06:45.879 --> 00:06:47.519
Actually, I can go back by myself.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.879
No, I’m not comfortable with your current condition.

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.920
Get in the car.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.319
Look at you.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.160
You had so many great choices,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.519
but you chose Lu Ming.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:26.680
Mom.

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.160
Lu Ming is a promising artist.

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.279
Artist?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.639
What kind of artist is he?

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.480
At best, he’s just a painter.

00:07:34.639 --> 00:07:36.439
That’s because he’s still young.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.639
He hasn’t achieved much yet.

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:40.120
He hasn’t achieved anything now.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.399
When will he ever achieve something?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:42.360
Ten years? Five years?

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:43.279
Seven years? Eight years?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.639
Did you hear what I just said?

00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:51.600
What’s wrong?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.519
Are you still a bit nervous?

00:07:58.639 --> 00:08:00.040
It’s been so long since I saw my mom.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:02.720
I don’t know, when I see her again,

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:04.800
how she’ll treat me.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.519
So many years have passed.

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:11.600
I hope she can let go of what she needs to.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.040
Are you worried she’ll make things difficult for you?

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.360
Xu Xin, Dr. Xu said

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.839
spend more time with family.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.079
It’ll help with your symptoms.

00:08:25.079 --> 00:08:27.480
So don’t worry about me.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:31.759
As long as it’s good for you, I’m fine with anything.

00:08:33.639 --> 00:08:34.320
Besides,

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:35.960
you and your sister

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.360
haven’t seen each other in a long time, right?

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.759
Sister?

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:45.159
Yeah, your sister Xu Yuan.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:50.120
Xu Yuan.

00:08:53.639 --> 00:08:54.559
My sister.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.440
About your sister,

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.480
how much do you still remember?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.559
I remember some things.

00:09:50.399 --> 00:09:51.000
It's fine.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.840
I'll park your car for you, Mr. Lu.

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:46.000
Thank you, I can't.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.559
Honey.

00:10:53.759 --> 00:10:54.720
Don't smoke near your sister.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.360
I'll listen to you.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:10.000
Sister, it's been so long.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.200
You're still so beautiful.

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.279
How's your injury?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.039
Much better.

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.600
You were driving that day, right?

00:11:29.519 --> 00:11:31.279
Accidents happen, it's inevitable.

00:11:32.759 --> 00:11:33.320
Lu Ming.

00:11:33.519 --> 00:11:35.039
Although we're meeting for the first time today,

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.120
I've heard about your exhibition before.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.000
I heard you're preparing a new show.

00:11:39.159 --> 00:11:39.879
What's the theme?

00:11:40.759 --> 00:11:41.679
When will it be shown?

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:43.240
I'm working on it.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.120
How far along are you?

00:11:45.639 --> 00:11:47.600
It's not convenient to say yet.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.919
We're all family here.

00:11:50.279 --> 00:11:52.120
Do you still need to keep secrets from us, brother-in-law?

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:57.039
Does he really see us as family?

00:12:03.559 --> 00:12:04.759
You both came a long way.

00:12:05.159 --> 00:12:06.480
Stay and have a meal with us.

00:12:07.039 --> 00:12:09.840
Our family chef cooks really well.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.720
Xu Yuan likes Western food.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.679
So Zheng Zhi hired a chef to cook at home.

00:12:23.399 --> 00:12:24.679
It might not suit your taste.

00:12:25.279 --> 00:12:26.360
Hope you can get used to it.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.200
Let's eat.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:37.519
Brother-in-law.

00:12:37.879 --> 00:12:39.960
Zheng Zhi took me to see your exhibition before.

00:12:40.519 --> 00:12:41.720
I couldn't really understand it.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.679
I remember one piece was a woman's head.

00:12:47.919 --> 00:12:50.120
I had nightmares after seeing it.

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:52.240
You're talking about

00:12:53.919 --> 00:12:54.840
"Twenty-Four," right?

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:57.159
That piece

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.240
is a metaphor for a woman being objectified.

00:13:00.799 --> 00:13:02.200
She's traded like a commodity.

00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.080
She's in pain and wants to scream.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.960
But her throat is stuffed with copper.

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.159
So only blood comes out of her mouth.

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:18.360
Do you have to talk about this at dinner?

00:13:22.879 --> 00:13:23.840
I've said it before,

00:13:24.279 --> 00:13:25.879
artists like you

00:13:26.039 --> 00:13:27.240
think differently from normal people.

00:13:31.159 --> 00:13:33.480
Mom, please stop talking about Lu Ming.

00:13:33.639 --> 00:13:35.679
If you don't like it, you don't have to come back.

00:13:36.039 --> 00:13:38.120
Weren't you pretty determined when you left?

00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.000
This toast is to my brother-in-law's family.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.600
I'm happy to see you all so happy.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:58.159
Cheers.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.440
Can't find us.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.480
Come on, go find them.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:23.519
Again.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.559
Got you.

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:31.360
Let's take a break.

00:14:34.559 --> 00:14:35.679
Let's switch to another kid.

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:36.519
I'll do it.

00:15:15.759 --> 00:15:16.279
Sis,

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:18.519
Are you okay?

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.120
I'm fine.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.960
Sis, do you still dance now?

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.440
I heard them say

00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.720
you forgot a lot after the accident.

00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.559
Do you still remember when we were kids,

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:40.840
how we used to dance together?

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.519
I remember.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.120
How did you meet Zheng Zhi?

00:15:46.759 --> 00:15:48.840
Through a blind date. Mom introduced us.

00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:51.000
Is he good to you?

00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.639
I'm very happy now.

00:15:55.279 --> 00:15:56.000
What about Lu Ming?

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.399
I'm happy too.

00:16:02.279 --> 00:16:04.279
Sis, if you have time in the future,

00:16:04.279 --> 00:16:05.600
come visit me often.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.919
I want to talk more about our childhood with you.

00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.519
Let's go back to the living room then.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:14.200
You go ahead.

00:16:14.919 --> 00:16:16.399
I want to stay here alone for a while.

00:17:15.519 --> 00:17:17.599
Happy anniversary.

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:26.039
Happy anniversary, my dear.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.960
But today isn’t the actual day.

00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.599
I was on a business trip before, so I couldn’t be with you.

00:17:32.039 --> 00:17:32.759
So we’re making up for it today.

00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:34.640
That’s what Mom wanted too.

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:44.000
That’s nice.

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.720
Still so sweet together.

00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.480
Come on, come on.

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.000
Let’s go.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:03.559
This project is even better than the last one.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.799
It’s settled then.

00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.000
We’re sure to make a profit.

00:18:10.799 --> 00:18:11.920
Let me tell you,

00:18:12.079 --> 00:18:13.640
the project manager is a distant relative of mine.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.359
Mom, we’ll head back now.

00:18:16.119 --> 00:18:18.039
Once it starts, it’ll definitely double.

00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:20.920
Then introduce me to him.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:22.160
Sure.

00:18:22.920 --> 00:18:24.799
I’ll set up a meeting with the manager then.

00:18:25.799 --> 00:18:27.079
Let me know when it’s arranged.

00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:30.160
Alright, don’t worry.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:31.599
Then I’ll count on you.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:32.920
I want to be involved too.

00:18:33.119 --> 00:18:34.559
No problem, I’ll handle it.

00:18:38.240 --> 00:18:39.039
Dr. Xu.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:41.799
Xu Xin has been acting strange lately.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:46.000
She keeps bringing up

00:18:47.079 --> 00:18:48.680
things that never happened.

00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.440
In your opinion, is Xu Xin’s condition

00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.680
normal?

00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.960
Her recovery

00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:02.480
isn’t quite what I expected.

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:04.839
It’s as if someone

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:06.359
has been influencing her all along.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:10.920
She’s recovering much faster than I imagined.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.200
Lately, there’s someone

00:19:16.519 --> 00:19:18.839
who seems to want Xu Xin to remember the past.

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:22.480
Dr. Xu.

00:19:23.279 --> 00:19:26.279
In any case, you must stop Xu Xin from regaining her memory.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.759
I’ll do my best.

00:19:31.839 --> 00:19:33.920
Not your best—you must do it.

00:19:35.319 --> 00:19:36.920
Don’t forget our deal.

00:19:37.839 --> 00:19:38.799
You’ve already been paid.

00:21:12.759 --> 00:21:14.200
The brain is actually quite fascinating.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.240
It has its own defense mechanisms.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.279
Sometimes, your brain helps you forget certain things.

00:21:20.519 --> 00:21:21.640
What do you mean?

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:23.119
Little Tangyuan,

00:21:23.559 --> 00:21:24.400
what are you doing?

00:21:27.319 --> 00:21:28.400
Catching bugs.

00:21:29.119 --> 00:21:30.880
The bugs have already gone home with Mom for dinner.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:32.759
We should head home too.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:34.759
Let’s go.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:38.720
If there are things

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.920
you just can’t remember no matter how hard you try,

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.240
maybe your brain is telling you

00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.799
it’s better not to remember them.

00:21:44.359 --> 00:21:45.519
The way you say that

00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:47.480
really sounds like Dr. Xu.

00:21:49.519 --> 00:21:50.680
I’m not as impressive as he is.

00:23:34.279 --> 00:23:36.359
Sister, sister.

00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:37.799
Sister.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:40.160
Sister, help me! Xu Yuan!

00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.480
Xu Yuan, sister.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.799
Xu Yuan, are you okay? Help me!

00:23:43.359 --> 00:23:44.880
Xu Yuan, help me!

00:23:45.039 --> 00:23:45.640
I'll save you.

00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.720
Sister, I'll save you. I'll save you.

00:23:49.039 --> 00:23:52.359
Is anyone there? Help!

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.799
Is anyone here? Anybody?

00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.319
Sister, wait for me.

00:24:18.319 --> 00:24:20.720
Sister, what are you doing?

00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:22.559
I've seen this lock before.

00:24:23.799 --> 00:24:25.000
You've seen this lock?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:27.000
Where did you see this lock?

00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.279
Just like the human heart.

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:32.079
It hides many hidden mechanisms and secret paths.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.319
Is it Lu Ming?

00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:38.960
I didn't see that man's face clearly,

00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:40.599
but I've been wondering,

00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.680
who would do this to me?

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:44.880
Who built this thing?

00:24:46.279 --> 00:24:49.119
It was you. You and Lu Ming did it together.

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.480
Why are you doing this to me?

00:24:54.279 --> 00:24:55.759
You're just jealous of me and Zheng Zhi.

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:56.799
We have a better life than you.

00:24:57.119 --> 00:24:58.519
Xu Yuan, why would you think that?

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:00.920
Mom warned me long ago to be cautious of Lu Ming.

00:25:01.279 --> 00:25:02.799
So you came here to mock me?

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:04.240
Xu Yuan, calm down.

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.920
That's impossible.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:16.880
Sister, I'm so cold. Really cold.

00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:18.599
I'm here, sister.

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.079
In the blue sky, in the Milky Way,

00:25:36.519 --> 00:25:41.200
there's a little white boat.

00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:47.400
On the boat, there's an osmanthus tree.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:52.200
White rabbits are playing.

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:57.000
Sister, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you.

00:26:00.279 --> 00:26:03.680
I suddenly remembered so many things from childhood.

00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.920
When I was seven, I practiced ballet with you.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:18.039
At twelve, you were bullied by boys in our class.

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:21.759
I couldn't stand it and stood up for you.

00:26:23.599 --> 00:26:27.000
I got shot in the back with an air gun.

00:26:27.839 --> 00:26:28.960
The blood wouldn't stop.

00:26:31.039 --> 00:26:32.039
Even now,

00:26:32.519 --> 00:26:34.799
I still have a scar that won't go away.

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.079
Yes, right there.

00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:46.920
How did you know?

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.839
Sister, sister, I'm so scared.

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.119
No, that's not right.

00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:04.240
Xu Yuan.

00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.920
Sister, Xu Yuan, help me!

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.079
Xu Yuan.

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.440
Sister, Xu Yuan.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.000
Sister.

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:14.119
Help me.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.920
Help me, sister.

00:27:17.279 --> 00:27:18.200
Xu Yuan.

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.160
Xu Yuan.

00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:23.400
Xu Yuan.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.119
Xu Yuan.

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:26.640
Xu Yuan.

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:27.759
Xu Yuan.

00:27:29.279 --> 00:27:30.920
Xu Yuan.

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.240
Xu Yuan.

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.720
Xu Yuan.

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.519
What's wrong, Xu Xin?

00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:04.880
Calm down.

00:28:09.079 --> 00:28:11.799
Where's Xu Yuan? What did you do to her?

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:12.680
Xu Yuan.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.000
Who's Xu Yuan?

00:28:19.759 --> 00:28:20.319
Xu Xin.

00:28:21.079 --> 00:28:21.720
Xu Xin.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:23.440
Xu Xin.

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:26.519
Xu Xin.

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.440
Xu Xin.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.400
I saw it.

00:28:29.519 --> 00:28:31.079
Xu Yuan disappeared right in front of me.

00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:35.440
Who exactly is this Xu Yuan you're talking about?

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.559
My sister.

00:28:38.799 --> 00:28:39.480
Your sister?

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:42.839
What if I told you that you have no sister, you're an only child?

00:28:42.839 --> 00:28:43.880
Would you believe me?

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:45.880
Impossible. I saw her.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.839
It was you. I saw that device in college.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.960
What did you do to Xu Yuan?

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.640
How many times have you hallucinated now?

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:01.599
No, this isn't a hallucination.

00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.960
I definitely saw Professor Zhong's wife.

00:29:05.359 --> 00:29:06.400
And it was just yesterday.

00:29:06.599 --> 00:29:08.799
You were with me when I saw my mom and Xu Yuan.

00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.839
How could we have met your mother?

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:12.519
Your mom is in Meiling.

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:14.480
Listen to me, Xu Xin.

00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:15.519
Don't touch me.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.240
Stop running.

00:29:25.599 --> 00:29:27.160
Come here, come here, over this way.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:29.119
Stop running.

00:29:29.599 --> 00:29:30.119
Come here.

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.440
Stop running, stop running, be careful not to fall.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:34.799
Stop messing around.

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.440
Come on, sit down nicely.

00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:42.119
Why are you dressed like that?
