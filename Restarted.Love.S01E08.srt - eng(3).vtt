00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.159
Xu Xin

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.319
I was just about to talk to you.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.719
Xu Xin

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.760
Xu Xin, listen to me.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.840
Xu Xin

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.840
Listen to me.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.680
Xu Xin

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.760
Listen to me.

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:54.000
Lu Ming

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:58.159
Let him go.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:10.560
Xu Xin

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.759
Xu Xin, wake up.

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.840
Xu Xin

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.840
Xu Xin

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.080
Wake up.

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.919
Xu Xin

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.120
Yuan You

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.400
Where are we?

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.120
I don't know either.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.039
When I woke up just now,

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.439
I saw Lu Ming tying you up.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.800
I knocked him out while he wasn't looking.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.040
Is this the glass box you mentioned?

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.600
Yes.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.399
That's the one.

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:40.399
Xu Yuan was locked in here by Lu Ming.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.240
And this control lever.

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:46.879
Lu Ming used this control lever

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:47.920
to make Xu Yuan disappear.

00:04:48.079 --> 00:04:49.160
Let's call the police right away.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.160
It's useless, Xu Xin.

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:51.720
You have to understand,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.639
whether it's Xiao Ya or Xu Yuan,

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.439
no one in this world except you

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.319
remembers them anymore.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.560
So what should we do now?

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.000
Calm down.

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:06.199
Let me think.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.800
Let me think.

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.839
Let me think.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:38.600
Let me do it.

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.000
Yuan You.

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:02.439
Xu Xin.

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:05.879
Now it's time for him to face the consequences.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.399
We just need to push this control lever down,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.839
and you'll be free from him forever.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:36.800
Yuan You.

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.000
This isn't something you should do.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.000
You've already done enough for me.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.439
No.

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:16.680
Xu Xin.

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:19.120
No.

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.199
Xu Xin, don't.

00:07:28.399 --> 00:07:29.040
Xu Xin.

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:35.439
Xu Xin, don't.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.240
Xu Xin.

00:07:42.839 --> 00:07:43.920
Xu Xin, don't.

00:07:45.879 --> 00:07:46.560
No.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.480
No, Xu Xin.

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.240
No.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.879
Please, no, Xu Xin.

00:08:35.399 --> 00:08:36.679
Please, no, Xu Xin.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.519
Hello?

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.159
I'm not feeling well today, I can't come.

00:09:51.799 --> 00:09:52.879
Can you cover for me today?

00:09:54.519 --> 00:09:56.360
What do you mean by slacking off, bro?

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.759
Last time you weren't feeling well,

00:09:57.759 --> 00:09:58.960
I covered for you the whole day.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000
It's settled then.

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:00.720
I'm hanging up.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:44.840
Please, I'm begging you.

00:10:45.559 --> 00:10:46.399
I don't want to die.

00:10:46.759 --> 00:10:47.639
I don't want to die.

00:10:48.679 --> 00:10:49.480
Don't be afraid.

00:10:50.399 --> 00:10:52.399
You'll soon go to a new place.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.120
A very, very good place.

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:55.600
I don't want to die.

00:10:55.799 --> 00:10:56.600
I don't want to die.

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.480
Don't worry.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.159
You won't die.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:06.000
You're just going somewhere else.

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:07.679
It's a rebirth of the soul.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.240
No one will suffer because of this.

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.200
And no one will remember you.

00:11:15.279 --> 00:11:16.279
Don't be scared.

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:19.960
All of this is

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:22.559
a gift from above to me.

00:11:28.879 --> 00:11:30.840
You're about to go to a better place.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.720
And I'll keep all my memories of you

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:34.519
here with me.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.639
I once thought

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.799
my life would always be like this.

00:12:09.639 --> 00:12:13.080
Whether it was the old me or who I am now,

00:12:14.759 --> 00:12:17.159
except for this secret only I know,

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.879
I was just wasting my days away.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.120
Until

00:12:34.759 --> 00:12:36.320
the day you appeared.

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.080
Your smile was as warm as sunshine.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.120
I wanted to know you.

00:12:52.879 --> 00:12:54.279
I wanted to know everything about you.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:11.720
I learned your name.

00:13:13.399 --> 00:13:14.240
Xu Xin.

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:16.879
It's such a beautiful name.

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.879
You like reading.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:24.080
You love literature.

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.279
Do you like flowers?

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.399
I think you would.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.360
Little Tangyuan.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.120
Look.

00:13:37.679 --> 00:13:38.759
This is the sea.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.320
This is the beach.

00:13:40.799 --> 00:13:42.039
This is the sun.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.720
Let's go to the beach together someday, okay?

00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:53.039
You must be tired.

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:54.399
Have some water.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:57.159
Thank you.

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:05.159
I didn't realize taking care of kids every day was so exhausting.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.720
You all really work hard.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.320
It's okay.

00:14:08.639 --> 00:14:09.360
We're used to it.

00:14:12.759 --> 00:14:14.360
Since Little Tangyuan came here,

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:16.279
you're the one he's closest to.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.480
I don't know why,

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:26.039
but I also feel close to him when I see him.

00:14:27.399 --> 00:14:30.440
Even though he can't express his feelings,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.639
I can still feel a lot from him.

00:14:35.759 --> 00:14:36.600
He really likes you.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480
I wonder

00:14:39.039 --> 00:14:40.679
if he thinks of you as his mom.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:48.639
I wish I could have a child like him.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:54.679
Miss Xu.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:55.480
You...

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:03.200
I have to go back.

00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.720
My husband is here to pick me up.

00:15:06.679 --> 00:15:07.440
Okay.

00:15:08.679 --> 00:15:09.480
Little Tangyuan.

00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.120
I'll give this back to you for now.

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:13.399
Bye-bye.

00:15:15.519 --> 00:15:16.120
Bye-bye.

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.279
But we can't be together.

00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.600
Because you have a husband.

00:15:31.679 --> 00:15:33.120
That troublesome Lu Ming.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:39.279
I could tell right away

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.200
you two aren't happy together.

00:16:06.639 --> 00:16:08.000
What happened

00:16:09.559 --> 00:16:11.399
was a chance given to me by fate.

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.360
Xu Xin.

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:22.720
Xu Xin.

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:15.599
Luckily, you weren't seriously hurt in the accident.

00:17:17.079 --> 00:17:18.759
But you lost all your memories of me.

00:17:19.839 --> 00:17:22.640
Yet fate still tied us together.

00:17:25.759 --> 00:17:26.599
That night,

00:17:27.519 --> 00:17:29.440
I intended to get rid of Chen Fei.

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:32.279
But your arrival stopped me.

00:17:51.079 --> 00:17:52.000
I know

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:54.160
that night, you didn't want to

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.359
leave with that man.

00:17:57.799 --> 00:18:00.119
Because we are the ones meant to be together.

00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:06.400
Xu Xin

00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:08.720
For you,

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.319
I can do anything.

00:19:17.839 --> 00:19:18.680
That's great.

00:19:19.279 --> 00:19:20.240
Thank you.

00:19:27.839 --> 00:19:28.799
I'm sorry.

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:48.000
I need to plant a seed in your heart.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:51.240
A seed that can help you

00:19:52.079 --> 00:19:54.640
awaken in this terrible marriage.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.640
Be patient.

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:17.559
Xu Xin,

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:21.240
I will save you.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.079
I'll make use of everything I have.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:28.880
Sorry about that.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.319
Children are a good cover.

00:20:31.359 --> 00:20:31.920
But

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.079
they can also cause unexpected trouble.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:49.440
The door is locked.

00:20:59.079 --> 00:21:00.200
I guided Little Tangyuan

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.680
to draw a picture of the crime scene.

00:21:04.359 --> 00:21:06.119
It will bring us together again.

00:21:59.599 --> 00:22:03.039
One day, I'll share my secrets with you.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.319
About this machine.

00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:08.680
About everything about me.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:11.720
But not now.

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.799
The rift between you is growing wider.

00:22:18.039 --> 00:22:19.400
And that's exactly what I need.

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:23.160
If you want to be reborn,

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:26.920
you must go through rebirth through nirvana.

00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:11.400
Xu Yuan, sis.

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:12.640
Xu Yuan, sis, save me.

00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.279
Sis.

00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:16.720
Sis.

00:23:17.519 --> 00:23:18.640
Sis, help me.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.680
Xu Yuan.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.839
Xu Yuan.

00:23:27.599 --> 00:23:29.319
You can only rely on me now.

00:23:32.319 --> 00:23:34.240
Don't let me see you here again.

00:23:34.319 --> 00:23:35.039
Go.

00:23:38.319 --> 00:23:39.960
You really did come to me.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:46.000
Everything went so smoothly.

00:23:47.759 --> 00:23:49.720
Even Chen Fei, the unpredictable one,

00:23:50.559 --> 00:23:52.279
became our catalyst.

00:24:12.759 --> 00:24:15.200
She's mentally and intellectually healthy.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.519
Give me some time.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:18.720
I believe she'll regain her mental health.

00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.039
Thank you.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.119
You're welcome.

00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.880
I can use my knowledge to help them.

00:24:24.359 --> 00:24:25.480
I find it very meaningful.

00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.640
It's also why I studied psychology.

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.599
What's wrong?

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:36.359
Want some candy?

00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.359
You want candy, huh?

00:24:37.799 --> 00:24:39.119
Let uncle take you to get some, okay?

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.319
Wait for me a moment.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.119
The candy's outside.

00:24:43.839 --> 00:24:44.400
Let's go.

00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.359
Divorce.

00:24:59.799 --> 00:25:01.039
Just as I suspected.

00:25:02.119 --> 00:25:03.839
That man has been lying to you all along.

00:25:07.599 --> 00:25:08.519
I'll get you

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:12.119
out of this toxic marriage.

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.440
This is the happiest time of my life.

00:25:57.559 --> 00:26:00.839
Our hearts have never been this close.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.000
Xu Xin,

00:26:05.319 --> 00:26:06.119
I love you.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:09.759
I'm the only one you can rely on now.

00:26:14.039 --> 00:26:15.160
Just a little more.

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:17.960
I want to expose that person's ugliness

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:21.160
completely in front of you.

00:27:56.839 --> 00:27:57.279
Xu Xin

00:27:58.039 --> 00:27:58.880
Xu Xin, listen to me.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:01.920
Let him go.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:09.839
Xu Xin

00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.440
Xu Xin

00:28:55.359 --> 00:28:56.160
Xu Xin

00:28:57.759 --> 00:28:58.519
Don't.

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.519
Xu Xin

00:29:03.079 --> 00:29:04.440
If you don't push it down,

00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:07.319
Lu Ming won't let you go.

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:12.599
Think about Xiao Ya.

00:29:20.119 --> 00:29:21.160
And your sister.

00:29:27.839 --> 00:29:29.359
And the girl in red.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.440
Little Tangyuan drew a girl.

00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:39.720
They can't die in vain.

00:29:40.279 --> 00:29:41.799
Someone has to stand up for them.

00:29:41.799 --> 00:29:42.680
Xu Xin

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:44.920
Don't, Xu Xin.

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:48.920
Don't.

00:29:58.519 --> 00:30:00.720
I don't think I've ever told you.

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:04.400
That girl was wearing red, right?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.920
You told me.

00:30:15.799 --> 00:30:16.400
No.

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.680
I never told you.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.160
You definitely told me.

00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160
You forgot, Xu Xin.

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.559
I'm sure I never told you.

00:30:30.799 --> 00:30:31.480
And also,

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.559
Lu Ming

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.480
Why is his mouth gagged?

00:30:40.079 --> 00:30:41.440
He's been lying to you all along.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.839
Do you still want to listen to his nonsense?

00:30:42.839 --> 00:30:44.079
Wait, Yuan You.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.279
We all need to calm down right now.

00:30:49.119 --> 00:30:51.839
Lu Ming can't fight back anymore.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:54.000
What we need to do now

00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.000
is find someone to help us.

00:30:57.559 --> 00:30:58.960
Someone will definitely help us.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.640
Xu Xin

00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.240
No one will believe us anymore.

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:08.519
If you don't do it,

00:31:08.519 --> 00:31:09.599
I'll decide for you.

00:31:10.279 --> 00:31:11.000
Yuan You

00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:22.240
If...

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.880
If Lu Ming really killed them,

00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:34.359
I don't want you to become like him.

00:31:42.039 --> 00:31:43.279
Calm down.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:47.839
Calm down.

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.720
Calm down.

00:31:54.559 --> 00:31:55.680
Don't do this.

00:31:57.839 --> 00:31:58.680
Don't do this.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:31:59.559
Xu Xin

00:32:00.759 --> 00:32:03.640
One day you'll thank me.

00:32:04.039 --> 00:32:04.400
Yuan You

00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:04.960
Let go.

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:05.759
Yuan You

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:06.880
Let go.

00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.839
Why are you treating me like this?

00:32:17.519 --> 00:32:18.480
I've done so much for you.

00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:19.880
Why don't you trust me?

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.240
Why?

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.039
Let go.

00:32:32.279 --> 00:32:33.279
Let her go.

00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.960
Xu Xin

00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.759
Xu Xin

00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:51.880
Xu Xin

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.759
I believe everyone here

00:33:07.759 --> 00:33:08.720
from childhood to now,

00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.480
whether from books,

00:33:10.519 --> 00:33:12.359
the stage, or the big screen,

00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.359
have all encountered

00:33:13.359 --> 00:33:14.519
many classic masterpieces.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:16.680
And there are many different opinions.

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.079
So, who would like to share?

00:33:24.079 --> 00:33:25.680
I'm sure everyone's tired of hearing

00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:26.960
Xu Xin's opinions.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.079
Let's hear from someone else.

00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:31.960
This student.

00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.680
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:40.119
Yes.
