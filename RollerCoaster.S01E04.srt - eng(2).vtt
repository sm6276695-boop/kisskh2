00:00:05.257 --> 00:00:07.787
So, you’re here as Air’s on a honeymoon trip, right?

00:00:07.787 --> 00:00:10.257
If I came here because Air was on the honeymoon trip,

00:00:10.257 --> 00:00:11.456
what would it be?

00:00:11.456 --> 00:00:13.257
Well, I would be a bit sad.

00:00:13.257 --> 00:00:15.956
I don’t want to replace anyone. That’s it.

00:00:15.956 --> 00:00:16.857
Oops!!!

00:00:19.357 --> 00:00:21.757
Have you ever ridden a roller coaster?

00:00:21.757 --> 00:00:22.757
The more you risk,

00:00:22.757 --> 00:00:23.857
the more exciting it is.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:27.557
And if I want to try it,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:30.757
what do I need to do?

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.457
Air, no leaving!

00:01:24.457 --> 00:01:26.556
Pure, stay with me!

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:41.556
Air, please don’t go!

00:03:03.257 --> 00:03:04.657
You can’t sleep?

00:03:04.657 --> 00:03:06.657
Umm.

00:03:06.657 --> 00:03:08.356
Do you want some?

00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:10.557
Yes, please.

00:03:15.356 --> 00:03:16.657
Oh!

00:03:16.657 --> 00:03:19.557
You took mine!

00:03:23.657 --> 00:03:26.057
Actually, I don’t want you to leave.

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:28.856
Can you work here instead?

00:03:28.856 --> 00:03:30.657
No, I can’t.

00:03:30.657 --> 00:03:32.456
It’s the same.

00:03:32.456 --> 00:03:36.057
You can’t always be in Bangkok either.

00:03:36.057 --> 00:03:38.057
Another thing is,

00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:41.557
I’m not leaving tomorrow.

00:03:41.557 --> 00:03:44.657
But you’re going to leave, anyway.

00:03:44.657 --> 00:03:47.257
If you’ll be missing me a lot,

00:03:47.257 --> 00:03:49.257
you could go to Bangkok to see me.

00:03:49.257 --> 00:03:50.557
Are you challenging me?

00:03:50.557 --> 00:03:53.456
If I miss you, I’ll instantly drive to Bangkok.

00:03:53.456 --> 00:03:55.557
But are you sure?

00:04:07.257 --> 00:04:08.856
I really like it

00:04:08.856 --> 00:04:13.356
when you let me do whatever I want.

00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:15.657
Really?

00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:21.557
What else do you want to do?

00:04:43.357 --> 00:04:46.257
What if I imagined

00:04:46.257 --> 00:04:48.357
that I did something on your body,

00:04:48.357 --> 00:04:52.357
what would you say?

00:04:52.357 --> 00:04:53.557
No, I don’t think so.

00:05:19.757 --> 00:05:21.557
Stay still!

00:05:21.557 --> 00:05:25.557
Please, Pure.

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:38.557
You like being directed?

00:05:38.557 --> 00:05:42.956
More, please.

00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:44.857
Take it off!

00:05:44.857 --> 00:05:48.557
And have it done!

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.557
Lamp!

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:00.557
Huh?

00:06:00.557 --> 00:06:02.357
You can sleep on the bed.

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:04.357
I’ll sleep on the sofa instead.

00:06:04.357 --> 00:06:05.456
You don’t have to. I’m okay.

00:06:05.456 --> 00:06:07.456
We’re going back home the day after tomorrow.

00:06:07.456 --> 00:06:09.257
You can, really.

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:13.557
You can use the bed, I insist.

00:06:13.557 --> 00:06:15.357
Alright.

00:06:15.357 --> 00:06:18.557
I won’t sleep on the sofa.

00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:21.757
But please share the bad with me. That’s it.

00:06:21.757 --> 00:06:24.557
Come on! I don’t want you to have a backache.

00:06:28.257 --> 00:06:29.557
Okay.

00:09:11.556 --> 00:09:13.556
Keep circling! Keep circling!

00:09:14.556 --> 00:09:16.556
Enough! Come back here!

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:18.556
Enough!

00:09:19.556 --> 00:09:20.556
Wow!

00:09:36.357 --> 00:09:37.556
Hello, Air.

00:09:37.556 --> 00:09:41.357
Pure, what are you doing?

00:09:41.357 --> 00:09:44.556
I’m now in upcountry with …

00:09:44.556 --> 00:09:47.556
Love and some other friends.

00:09:47.556 --> 00:09:50.457
Did you get my messages?

00:09:50.457 --> 00:09:54.056
Why don’t you reply to any?

00:09:54.056 --> 00:09:55.656
Oh.

00:09:55.656 --> 00:09:57.556
I forgot to do so.

00:10:17.556 --> 00:10:22.357
You did you talk to on the phone when we were at the beach?

00:10:22.357 --> 00:10:24.556
It was Air.

00:10:24.556 --> 00:10:27.056
I hadn’t answered her calls,

00:10:27.056 --> 00:10:31.357
So, she was worried about me.

00:10:31.357 --> 00:10:33.457
So, you’re going back to Bangkok tomorrow.

00:10:33.457 --> 00:10:34.556
What else do you want to do?

00:10:34.556 --> 00:10:36.957
Umm.

00:10:36.957 --> 00:10:39.457
I can spend time in the room.

00:10:39.457 --> 00:10:42.857
It was a long day. I’m a bit tired.

00:10:42.857 --> 00:10:45.656
I thought you would say you wanted to stay with me

00:10:45.656 --> 00:10:47.257
until I felt satisfied.

00:10:49.757 --> 00:10:52.556
Well… Who are you painting?

00:10:55.457 --> 00:10:56.556
A human …

00:10:56.556 --> 00:10:59.257
In general.

00:10:59.257 --> 00:11:01.556
If it was me,

00:11:01.556 --> 00:11:03.257
you’d be charged.

00:11:03.257 --> 00:11:04.757
Hmm?

00:11:04.757 --> 00:11:05.556
So stingy!

00:11:05.556 --> 00:11:07.556
Oh! It’s me whom you are painting, isn’t it?

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:08.556
Can I have a look at it?

00:11:08.556 --> 00:11:09.556
What?!

00:11:09.556 --> 00:11:10.556
Share it with me, please!

00:11:13.257 --> 00:11:13.757
Sigh!

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:16.257
I don’t want to see it now.

00:11:16.257 --> 00:11:19.757
But tonight

00:11:19.757 --> 00:11:25.056
can I be with you?

00:11:25.056 --> 00:11:27.857
Don’t you like it?

00:11:27.857 --> 00:11:30.556
Oh! Is it my one-sided preference?

00:11:32.556 --> 00:11:34.457
I didn’t say I didn’t like it.

00:11:34.457 --> 00:11:35.757
But normally,

00:11:35.757 --> 00:11:39.556
I don’t do that without reason.

00:11:40.457 --> 00:11:42.556
But do you like it?

00:11:45.257 --> 00:11:47.257
Umm.

00:11:47.257 --> 00:11:48.257
Is that enough?

00:11:48.257 --> 00:11:49.556
I’ll pack my stuff.

00:11:49.556 --> 00:11:51.556
Umm.

00:11:51.556 --> 00:11:53.357
So.

00:11:53.357 --> 00:11:55.457
We’re eating out tonight.

00:11:55.457 --> 00:11:58.757
I didn’t ask the maid to prepare us food.

00:11:58.757 --> 00:12:00.556
You want to try my cooking?

00:12:02.556 --> 00:12:03.556
Well!

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:06.056
Can you cook?

00:12:06.056 --> 00:12:07.556
Umm.

00:12:07.556 --> 00:12:09.257
You know?

00:12:09.257 --> 00:12:12.056
I’m as skilled as those Master Chef people.

00:12:12.056 --> 00:12:13.656
You want me to start now?

00:12:13.656 --> 00:12:15.257
Alright!

00:12:15.257 --> 00:12:19.757
But is a kitchen hand needed?

00:12:19.757 --> 00:12:21.556
Maybe.

00:12:21.556 --> 00:12:24.556
What?!

00:12:24.556 --> 00:12:27.556
I want spaghetti.

00:12:41.257 --> 00:12:42.457
Well.

00:12:42.457 --> 00:12:43.656
You’re a helper.

00:12:43.656 --> 00:12:45.556
You should help. You shouldn’t keep looking at me.

00:12:45.556 --> 00:12:47.556
Why?!

00:12:47.556 --> 00:12:49.257
You’re blushing because of me?

00:12:49.257 --> 00:12:50.556
Not at all.

00:12:50.556 --> 00:12:52.556
If you can’t help,

00:12:52.556 --> 00:12:55.556
please go there.

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.056
Oh!

00:13:20.056 --> 00:13:21.556
I thought you could help.

00:13:21.556 --> 00:13:26.556
But you made the bubble milk tea instead?

00:13:26.556 --> 00:13:29.056
Can you get that pepper for me?

00:13:29.056 --> 00:13:30.556
A moment, please.

00:13:33.556 --> 00:13:36.556
Here you are.

00:13:40.556 --> 00:13:42.556
What?!

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:45.056
Do I look funny?

00:13:45.056 --> 00:13:47.056
No, you don’t.

00:13:47.056 --> 00:13:48.556
But it looks tasty.

00:14:01.556 --> 00:14:03.556
Yummy?

00:14:09.556 --> 00:14:10.556
Oh!

00:14:10.556 --> 00:14:13.556
I’ll make salad dressing now.

00:14:21.556 --> 00:14:23.556
Done.

00:14:27.556 --> 00:14:30.556
What’s next?

00:14:30.556 --> 00:14:32.556
Oh! You don’t like it?

00:14:43.556 --> 00:14:44.556
This too.

00:14:46.556 --> 00:14:48.556
Almost getting into my eyes.

00:14:48.556 --> 00:14:49.556
This too.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:52.149
This room!

00:15:52.149 --> 00:15:53.050
Come on!

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.100
What?!

00:17:08.899 --> 00:17:12.000
I’ve got a dental dam.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.699
You’ve got it here like this.

00:17:14.699 --> 00:17:16.699
Do you often use it?

00:17:16.699 --> 00:17:18.699
I won’t answer the question.

00:17:18.699 --> 00:17:20.300
For more information,

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.300
Please talk to my lawyer.

00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.100
Naughty!

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:52.600
I’m not surprised

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.500
that everyone loves you.

00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.400
You’re so cute.

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:02.299
How can I stop loving you?

00:19:02.299 --> 00:19:04.100
You’re also cute.

00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:12.100
Will there

00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:16.100
ever be a day

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:18.600
that you love me too?

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.600
After you leave here,

00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600
can I call you?

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:33.600
Uh.

00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:37.600
Uh.

00:21:25.999 --> 00:21:26.900
Hello.

00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:28.900
Hello.

00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.600
It’s so boring when you’re not here.

00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:35.400
Are you saying things like this every day?

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:38.799
I miss you badly.

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.400
I told you before.

00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:41.999
If you miss me,

00:21:41.999 --> 00:21:43.299
come and see me here.

00:21:43.299 --> 00:21:45.799
Are you sure?

00:21:45.799 --> 00:21:47.799
Well, are you at the studio?

00:21:47.799 --> 00:21:49.200
Yes.

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.900
I’m teaching the evening class.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.900
What about you? Where are you now?

00:21:53.900 --> 00:21:55.499
Why is it so quiet?

00:21:55.499 --> 00:21:57.100
You’ve just woken up?

00:22:00.499 --> 00:22:01.100
Hello!

00:22:05.499 --> 00:22:07.600
Do you believe that I miss you?

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:56.600
Tem!

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.600
Yes, Mom.

00:22:58.600 --> 00:22:59.600
What, Mom?

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:00.600
Who’s that?

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.900
Tell me more, Tem.

00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.600
I’m not quite sure.

00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:09.100
But it might be …

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:10.600
I don’t know. But …

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:12.600
Does she come here often?

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:19.100
To my knowledge, quite often.

00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:20.600
The outstanding staff, you’re.

00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:20.900
Huh!

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:21.600
After this,

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.100
I’m reporting to you

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:22.600
everything

00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:23.100
that I know

00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:23.600
that I see

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.100
that I hear.

00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:24.600
Everything!

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.600
Mom.

00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:30.600
Tem!

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:31.600
What’s that cloth?

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:32.600
Oops!

00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.600
Tem!

00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.600
Excuse me. I’ve to do housekeeping now.

00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:41.600
See you later.

00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.600
Okay!

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.600
Mom,

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.100
this is Loft.

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.100
A close junior …

00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.900
of mine.

00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.100
A very close one, Mom.

00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:55.100
Hello.

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.600
Hi.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:00.400
So, are you sure you can drive back by yourself?

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.100
Oh! My driver is driving.

00:24:03.100 --> 00:24:04.100
to Phetchaburi.

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.600
I’m not driving today.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:08.100
Don’t worry.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.100
So, I’ve to go now.

00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:10.900
Bye.

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.900
Excuse me, Mom. I’ve to go now.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:12.400
Alright.

00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.100
Bye.

00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:14.100
Safe ride, honey.

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:18.600
Thank you.

00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:20.600
Who’s that?

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.600
Who’s she?

00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:24.600
Umm.

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.600
Tell me, please.

00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:53.600
She’s cute.

00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:56.600
Your girlfriend?

00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.600
What, Mom?!

00:24:57.600 --> 00:24:59.899
I told you she’s a close junior.

00:24:59.899 --> 00:25:02.600
Very close!

00:25:04.899 --> 00:25:06.600
If you like her, just get together.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.100
No need to be that blushing.

00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:13.600
You’re almost 30.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:14.600
Sigh!

00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600
It’s good that you could move on from Air.

00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.100
That would relieve my worries.

00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.100
Who told you that I can move on?

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:25.100
How come you said that?

00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.600
What Mom?!

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:32.100
If you don’t feel anything for Loft, why do you give her hope?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:36.100
I haven’t given her hope.

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.600
Well.

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.100
Loft always knows

00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.100
that I can’t move on.

00:25:44.100 --> 00:25:46.100
Loft knows

00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:49.600
her status well.

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.100
What status?

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:58.100
Are you sure she’s fine with this?

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.100
You shouldn’t make things complicated.

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.600
I left it there.

00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:27.100
I love this necklace a lot.

00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.600
I’ll do whatever.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.100
To be able to see you again soon.

00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.100
Hello.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:37.600
Why didn’t you tell me earlier?

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:39.100
If I knew, I would bring it back with me.

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.600
It’ll be a few days

00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.100
until I’m going to the studio again.

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.100
It might be lost.

00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.100
It’s okay.

00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:46.600
Just leave it here.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:51.100
To prevent you from others’ flirting.

00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.600
What?!

00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.600
You just say whatever pops into your head, huh?

00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:57.600
Well, I’m hanging up.

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600
Well?!

00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600
I miss you.

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:14.600
Send me a photo, please.

00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:16.600
I’m taking a shower.

00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.600
Can it be later?

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.600
Wow! Sexy!

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.600
I mean after I finish.

00:27:26.600 --> 00:27:28.600
It will be later.

00:27:51.100 --> 00:27:51.600
Pure,

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.100
what are you doing?

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.100
Did you come back from the studio?

00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:59.600
Can I see you at the condo?

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:01.100
Unless you say you miss me,

00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.100
you can come here.

00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.100
I miss you.

00:28:53.833 --> 00:29:00.234
Oh!

00:29:00.234 --> 00:29:01.333
You went to France.

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:03.533
For traveling or working?

00:29:03.533 --> 00:29:06.033
How could you have time for shopping?

00:29:06.033 --> 00:29:18.533
I went to work.

00:29:18.533 --> 00:29:20.033
You went on a honeymoon trip!

00:29:20.033 --> 00:29:21.134
Did you have so much fun?

00:29:21.134 --> 00:29:22.933
Why didn’t you tell me about this?

00:29:22.933 --> 00:29:24.433
Or, are you happier after spending time with him

00:29:24.433 --> 00:29:26.433
than being with me?

00:29:30.134 --> 00:29:32.134
Pure!

00:29:32.134 --> 00:29:33.033
Yes.

00:29:33.033 --> 00:29:35.334
Are you alright?

00:29:35.334 --> 00:29:36.033
Err.

00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:37.134
Did you have a good time

00:29:37.134 --> 00:29:38.334
in France?

00:29:41.134 --> 00:29:43.834
Well…

00:29:43.834 --> 00:29:45.034
They might think

00:29:45.034 --> 00:29:47.634
it was a honeymoon trip.

00:29:47.634 --> 00:29:50.233
But for me,

00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:52.134
it’s called working.

00:29:54.834 --> 00:29:57.134
What about having a look at the things here?

00:29:57.134 --> 00:29:59.933
They are all good for you.

00:29:59.933 --> 00:30:01.334
Umm.

00:30:01.334 --> 00:30:02.634
Thank you.

00:30:02.634 --> 00:30:06.334
It’s good that you still remember what I like.

00:30:08.634 --> 00:30:10.834
I never forget

00:30:10.834 --> 00:30:13.134
what you like.

00:30:14.233 --> 00:30:15.933
And …

00:30:15.933 --> 00:30:17.834
Are you tired?

00:30:17.834 --> 00:30:20.034
Yes, I’m exhausted.

00:30:20.034 --> 00:30:20.933
Then,

00:30:20.933 --> 00:30:24.233
do you want something to drink?

00:30:24.233 --> 00:30:25.634
Pure.

00:30:25.634 --> 00:30:27.034
Huh?

00:30:27.034 --> 00:30:32.933
Well, …

00:30:32.933 --> 00:30:33.733
Yes.

00:30:33.733 --> 00:30:34.534
Whatever.

00:30:34.534 --> 00:30:35.433
As you like.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:36.233
Okay.

00:30:46.233 --> 00:30:48.034
What are you doing?

00:30:52.833 --> 00:30:53.833
Hello!

00:30:53.833 --> 00:30:56.434
Is there anybody there?

00:31:00.634 --> 00:31:01.534
Hello!

00:31:23.833 --> 00:31:25.634
Well, I miss you.

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:31.034
Why is it that easy today?

00:31:31.034 --> 00:31:33.833
You know well

00:31:33.833 --> 00:31:36.833
why I’ve avoided it.

00:31:36.833 --> 00:31:38.333
Well, yes.

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:41.733
Because you don’t like showing off your feelings.

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:43.934
But not every time

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:47.034
that I can guess your feelings.

00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:50.333
So,

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:51.534
from now on …

00:31:51.534 --> 00:31:54.134
I’ll keep saying it.

00:32:06.134 --> 00:32:07.934
Pure.

00:32:07.934 --> 00:32:10.434
Yes.

00:32:10.434 --> 00:32:13.233
You told me before

00:32:13.233 --> 00:32:15.134
you’re not waiting for me

00:32:15.134 --> 00:32:18.434
but you aren’t seeing anyone else.

00:32:18.434 --> 00:32:22.034
Is it still the same?

00:32:22.034 --> 00:32:25.833
Why did you ask me this?

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:30.833
There’s no one in my place, right?

00:32:33.934 --> 00:32:36.634
Can you promise me you won’t have anyone yet?

00:32:38.134 --> 00:32:40.233
Since we broke up,

00:32:40.233 --> 00:32:43.134
you’ve never asked me for something like this.

00:32:47.934 --> 00:32:50.934
It was me who asked you to break up with me.

00:32:50.934 --> 00:32:55.333
So, how could I ask you not to have anyone.

00:32:55.333 --> 00:33:00.033
But a moment ago, why did you ask me like that?

00:33:00.033 --> 00:33:02.934
I’m finishing up things in my life.

00:33:02.934 --> 00:33:05.634
It might take time.

00:33:05.634 --> 00:33:08.934
And I don’t know exactly how long it takes.

00:33:08.934 --> 00:33:10.634
But!

00:33:13.234 --> 00:33:16.434
Can you please wait for me?

00:33:16.434 --> 00:33:19.833
So it means …

00:33:19.833 --> 00:33:21.634
you’re divorcing?

00:33:26.134 --> 00:33:29.934
I’m trying to do so.

00:33:29.934 --> 00:33:31.934
Trying?!

00:33:31.934 --> 00:33:34.033
What do you mean?

00:33:34.033 --> 00:33:35.934
Up until now,

00:33:35.934 --> 00:33:39.134
you’ve been trying, haven’t you?

00:33:39.934 --> 00:33:42.234
But it never happens!

00:33:46.134 --> 00:33:48.134
I’m sorry.

00:33:50.033 --> 00:33:51.734
I can hear it.

00:33:51.734 --> 00:33:54.134
Another excuse from you.

00:33:54.134 --> 00:33:56.134
Pure!

00:33:57.634 --> 00:33:59.134
Come on!

00:33:59.134 --> 00:34:00.333
Even after we broke up,

00:34:00.333 --> 00:34:03.934
you’re still tough on me.

00:34:03.934 --> 00:34:06.833
I didn’t mean to do that.

00:34:06.833 --> 00:34:11.934
You’ve never accepted anything.

00:34:11.934 --> 00:34:14.833
So, what about this?

00:34:14.833 --> 00:34:17.634
If you want me to wait,

00:34:17.634 --> 00:34:19.333
stay here with me tonight.

00:34:40.934 --> 00:34:41.833
Hello.

00:34:41.833 --> 00:34:42.634
I’m sorry.

00:34:42.634 --> 00:34:45.033
Last night, there were some messy things here.

00:34:45.033 --> 00:34:46.934
I saw the messages.

00:34:46.934 --> 00:34:48.333
But it was quite late already.

00:34:48.333 --> 00:34:50.833
I thought you must have been to bed.

00:34:50.833 --> 00:34:53.333
You’re okay, right?

00:34:53.333 --> 00:34:55.134
I’m alright.

00:34:55.134 --> 00:34:57.134
It’s good then.

00:34:57.134 --> 00:34:59.434
Don’t you work?

00:34:59.434 --> 00:35:02.533
I’m going to the studio in the afternoon.

00:35:02.533 --> 00:35:05.833
Well,

00:35:05.833 --> 00:35:07.434
are you okay to talk?

00:35:07.434 --> 00:35:11.033
Yes, speaking.

00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:13.033
I mean …

00:35:13.033 --> 00:35:16.434
for VDO calling.

00:35:16.434 --> 00:35:17.934
Umm.

00:35:17.934 --> 00:35:20.434
Sure.

00:35:28.934 --> 00:35:30.634
You’re trying to make up with me?

00:35:30.634 --> 00:35:33.934
You are still sulky from last night, aren’t you?

00:35:33.934 --> 00:35:35.234
Not that much.

00:35:35.234 --> 00:35:37.234
I’m okay though you do nothing.

00:35:37.234 --> 00:35:38.833
No.

00:35:38.833 --> 00:35:41.833
I don’t like being someone who breaks a promise.

00:35:41.833 --> 00:35:43.934
So, where are you now?

00:35:43.934 --> 00:35:46.333
You really dressed up today!

00:35:46.333 --> 00:35:48.033
I’m painting

00:35:48.033 --> 00:35:51.134
the key visual for the exhibition opening.

00:35:51.134 --> 00:35:52.033
Really?

00:35:52.033 --> 00:35:53.934
Can I have a look at it?

00:35:53.934 --> 00:35:54.934
No.

00:35:54.934 --> 00:35:57.434
It’s a secret.

00:35:57.434 --> 00:35:59.333
Excuse me.

00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:00.333
Well, Pure.

00:36:00.333 --> 00:36:02.434
I’ve to go now.

00:36:02.434 --> 00:36:05.934
I’m doing good now.

00:36:05.934 --> 00:36:06.934
Okay!

00:36:06.934 --> 00:36:12.033
Talk to you later.

00:36:12.033 --> 00:36:16.033
Was that Pure?

00:36:32.234 --> 00:36:34.234
Thank you for this. / Oops! Your hair!

00:36:34.234 --> 00:36:36.234
For the secretary candidate interview tomorrow,

00:36:36.234 --> 00:36:39.134
should it be onsite or online interview?

00:36:39.134 --> 00:36:41.234
If it’s onsite, I’ll prepare a room for it.

00:36:41.234 --> 00:36:42.434
Umm. It can be online.

00:36:42.434 --> 00:36:44.934
Okay.

00:36:44.934 --> 00:36:46.134
Well, I almost forgot

00:36:46.134 --> 00:36:48.833
that your brother is coming here in the afternoon.

00:36:48.833 --> 00:36:49.734
This afternoon?

00:36:49.734 --> 00:36:51.234
Yes.

00:36:51.234 --> 00:36:53.934
Okay.

00:36:57.234 --> 00:36:59.134
Why didn’t you tell me about your visit before?

00:36:59.134 --> 00:37:00.833
Well, why?!

00:37:00.833 --> 00:37:02.833
I can’t see you here or what? Huh?

00:37:02.833 --> 00:37:05.033
It’s quite quiet at home these days.

00:37:05.033 --> 00:37:06.134
I just wanted to change my sleeping place.

00:37:06.134 --> 00:37:09.134
You know?

00:37:09.134 --> 00:37:11.234
You usually say you’re busy.

00:37:11.234 --> 00:37:14.533
What about Air? Where’s she now?

00:37:14.533 --> 00:37:19.234
She has her own way.

00:37:19.234 --> 00:37:21.134
Hey, Loft!

00:37:21.134 --> 00:37:23.933
Where’s your necklace?

00:37:23.933 --> 00:37:27.334
Don’t tell me you gave it to someone special again?

00:37:27.334 --> 00:37:29.234
No.

00:37:29.234 --> 00:37:31.334
It’s none of your business.

00:37:31.334 --> 00:37:32.033
Hey!

00:37:32.033 --> 00:37:33.234
See you at the pool!

00:37:33.234 --> 00:37:33.933
Bye!

00:38:27.482 --> 00:38:28.132
Lamp!

00:38:38.632 --> 00:38:40.781
Oh!!!

00:38:40.781 --> 00:38:42.181
If this was the sea,

00:38:42.181 --> 00:38:44.882
you’d be almost getting the island over there.

00:38:44.882 --> 00:38:45.681
Cheers!

00:38:45.681 --> 00:38:46.181
Cheers!

00:38:50.681 --> 00:38:51.482
Well,

00:38:51.482 --> 00:38:53.382
visiting Paris,

00:38:53.382 --> 00:38:55.181
should you have something for me?

00:38:55.181 --> 00:38:55.681
Here it is.

00:38:55.681 --> 00:38:56.681
Ooh!

00:38:56.681 --> 00:38:57.681
Oh!

00:38:57.681 --> 00:38:59.181
You were there many days.

00:38:59.181 --> 00:39:02.082
How come there’s nothing for me?

00:39:02.082 --> 00:39:04.181
Or?!

00:39:04.181 --> 00:39:06.582
You enjoyed the honeymoon trip so much that you forgot me.

00:39:06.582 --> 00:39:08.082
Huh, my brother?!

00:39:08.082 --> 00:39:09.082
No. You’re wrong.

00:39:09.082 --> 00:39:11.582
I mean Air didn’t want to go out.

00:39:11.582 --> 00:39:13.681
I mostly stayed in.

00:39:13.681 --> 00:39:14.481
Well, and …

00:39:14.481 --> 00:39:16.681
How’s she now?

00:39:16.681 --> 00:39:20.132
Has she slightly fallen for you?

00:39:24.882 --> 00:39:26.132
What’s wrong?!

00:39:37.582 --> 00:39:40.181
I think …

00:39:40.181 --> 00:39:43.181
it’s time.

00:39:43.181 --> 00:39:44.132
Huh?

00:39:58.882 --> 00:40:02.132
We’re seriously ending up, aren’t we?

00:40:09.382 --> 00:40:11.132
Please divorce me, Lamp.

00:40:16.782 --> 00:40:19.132
I’ve been thinking about this too.

00:40:21.682 --> 00:40:24.132
Can you give me more time?

00:40:53.581 --> 00:40:55.182
Morning!

00:40:55.182 --> 00:40:56.682
Are you up?

00:40:56.682 --> 00:40:59.182
I didn’t mean to wake you up.

00:40:59.182 --> 00:41:00.682
I’m looking for my son.

00:41:00.682 --> 00:41:02.182
Well,

00:41:02.182 --> 00:41:03.382
did you have a good sleep?

00:41:03.382 --> 00:41:04.682
Yes.

00:41:04.682 --> 00:41:05.682
Hey!

00:41:05.682 --> 00:41:07.182
Look!

00:41:07.182 --> 00:41:10.981
Cute pyjamas!

00:41:10.981 --> 00:41:12.182
You can take

00:41:12.182 --> 00:41:13.882
any ones you like.

00:41:13.882 --> 00:41:15.182
I’ve so many here.

00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:16.581
Dumbo is mine.

00:41:16.581 --> 00:41:17.382
Sure.

00:41:17.382 --> 00:41:20.081
Your Dumbo ones can be paired up with those of Bisou.

00:41:21.481 --> 00:41:23.382
Are you alright?

00:41:23.382 --> 00:41:25.382
I’m leaving shortly.

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.282
Uh!

00:41:26.282 --> 00:41:27.182
Thank you

00:41:27.182 --> 00:41:28.581
for offering me a night here.

00:41:28.581 --> 00:41:29.481
No problem.

00:41:29.481 --> 00:41:30.382
Well,

00:41:30.382 --> 00:41:32.132
does the glue work?

00:41:34.882 --> 00:41:36.682
So, …

00:41:36.682 --> 00:41:38.132
can you stay with me tonight?

00:41:40.481 --> 00:41:42.382
I can’t do it now.

00:41:42.382 --> 00:41:45.481
I don’t want people to think we’re doing something wrong.

00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:48.382
Do you want to keep being a good one?

00:41:48.382 --> 00:41:49.882
Are you sure you can be a good one?

00:41:49.882 --> 00:41:52.182
A good one who has been hurting me terribly like this?

00:41:52.182 --> 00:41:53.882
What did I do wrong?

00:41:53.882 --> 00:41:55.682
Since I was the first.

00:41:55.682 --> 00:41:57.481
Don’t be quiet!

00:41:57.481 --> 00:41:59.182
And I did tell you before.

00:41:59.182 --> 00:42:01.182
You don’t need to buy me these things.

00:42:01.182 --> 00:42:03.782
If you can’t break up with him,

00:42:03.782 --> 00:42:06.132
leave me alone.

00:42:08.682 --> 00:42:10.132
Sigh!

00:42:25.182 --> 00:42:26.081
Air!

00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:27.132
Air!

00:42:28.781 --> 00:42:30.382
I’m sorry.

00:42:30.382 --> 00:42:31.982
Air, please!

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:33.682
I’m sorry.

00:42:33.682 --> 00:42:35.182
Air, listen!

00:42:35.182 --> 00:42:37.132
I’m sorry ... I didn’t mean to …

00:42:47.682 --> 00:42:49.482
It was broken.

00:42:49.482 --> 00:42:51.382
No matter how hard you try,

00:42:51.382 --> 00:42:53.132
a crack can still be seen.

00:42:54.882 --> 00:42:57.382
The crack is still here.

00:42:57.382 --> 00:42:57.982
Look!

00:42:57.982 --> 00:42:58.482
Bisou, look at that.

00:42:58.482 --> 00:42:59.132
Bisou, can you see it?

00:43:03.882 --> 00:43:05.382
So,

00:43:05.382 --> 00:43:07.132
what did you tell her?

00:43:09.482 --> 00:43:11.132
I just asked for more time.

00:43:15.281 --> 00:43:18.682
I might have no other way to hold her.

00:43:18.682 --> 00:43:22.132
We both know Air’s been longing for the divorce.

00:43:28.482 --> 00:43:29.132
Loft,

00:43:31.182 --> 00:43:33.132
if that day comes,

00:43:34.382 --> 00:43:35.132
what do you think?

00:43:39.982 --> 00:43:42.182
It’s you only,

00:43:42.182 --> 00:43:45.182
who can make a decision.

00:43:45.182 --> 00:43:47.882
Your happiness

00:43:47.882 --> 00:43:50.132
belongs to you.

00:43:55.281 --> 00:43:56.581
Hello, Mom.

00:43:56.581 --> 00:43:59.482
I can’t reach Air after you guys came back from France.

00:43:59.482 --> 00:44:02.132
I went to the office, but I didn’t see her.

00:44:04.781 --> 00:44:05.781
Oh!

00:44:05.781 --> 00:44:07.682
She went to see her friend, Bam.

00:44:07.682 --> 00:44:08.781
Bam is sick.

00:44:08.781 --> 00:44:11.482
So, she needs Air to take care of her.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.382
Well,

00:44:12.382 --> 00:44:16.081
if I meet her, I’ll ask her to call you back as soon as possible.

00:44:16.081 --> 00:44:16.581
Alright.

00:44:16.581 --> 00:44:17.132
Okay, Mom.

00:44:47.682 --> 00:44:48.682
Hello.

00:44:48.682 --> 00:44:50.182
Where are you now?

00:44:50.182 --> 00:44:53.482
Your mom called me. She said she can’t reach you.

00:44:53.482 --> 00:44:55.182
I’ve been busy with some errands.

00:44:55.182 --> 00:44:56.682
I forgot to bring a charger.

00:44:56.682 --> 00:44:57.781
I’m sorry, Lamp.

00:44:57.781 --> 00:44:58.781
I’ll take care of

00:44:58.781 --> 00:45:00.482
my mom by myself.

00:45:00.482 --> 00:45:03.382
Where are you now?

00:45:03.382 --> 00:45:04.581
I’m driving.

00:45:04.581 --> 00:45:05.882
On the way to the office.

00:45:05.882 --> 00:45:07.132
Okay. Alright.

00:45:11.982 --> 00:45:13.281
Excuse me.

00:45:13.281 --> 00:45:14.682
Hello.

00:45:14.682 --> 00:45:16.382
Hello.

00:45:16.382 --> 00:45:18.581
Would you like to ask about classes or look for something here?

00:45:18.581 --> 00:45:19.281
Err.

00:45:19.281 --> 00:45:20.682
I want to see Pure.

00:45:20.682 --> 00:45:22.781
Is she in today?

00:45:22.781 --> 00:45:24.781
Oh. She’s off today.

00:45:24.781 --> 00:45:27.682
Shall I let her know now that you’re here to meet her?

00:45:27.682 --> 00:45:28.382
Umm.

00:45:28.382 --> 00:45:29.682
Well, maybe not.

00:45:29.682 --> 00:45:30.682
Thank you.

00:45:30.682 --> 00:45:31.682
Alright.

00:45:31.682 --> 00:45:32.682
Oops!

00:45:32.682 --> 00:45:33.182
Ooh!

00:45:35.581 --> 00:45:36.682
Please let me help.

00:45:36.682 --> 00:45:37.182
Thank you.

00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:47.182
Is the necklace

00:45:47.182 --> 00:45:48.132
for sale?

00:45:52.682 --> 00:45:54.482
Err…I’m afraid it’s not for sale.

00:45:54.482 --> 00:45:56.182
I’ve just seen it here.

00:45:56.182 --> 00:45:58.132
I think it might belong to Teacher Pure.

00:46:25.182 --> 00:46:27.132
Loft, who are you dating?

00:46:30.781 --> 00:46:32.132
Do I know that person?

00:47:51.181 --> 00:47:52.882
You’ve been traveling frequently.

00:47:52.882 --> 00:47:53.781
Don’t you feel tired?

00:47:53.781 --> 00:47:55.781
Not seeing you in person

00:47:55.781 --> 00:47:56.781
is more tiring.

00:47:56.781 --> 00:47:58.681
Ooh!

00:47:58.681 --> 00:48:00.882
If I get divorced,

00:48:00.882 --> 00:48:03.482
I’ll come back to hear your answer.

00:48:03.482 --> 00:48:05.882
I’ll be asking if you’d want to be with me.

00:48:05.882 --> 00:48:09.781
You know well I’ve been waiting for you.

00:48:09.781 --> 00:48:12.382
I’ve something to talk to you.

00:48:12.382 --> 00:48:13.482
Sure.

00:48:13.482 --> 00:48:16.482
I’ve decided.
