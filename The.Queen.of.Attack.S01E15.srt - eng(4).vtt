WEBVTT

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:10.400
=The Queen of Attack=

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.280
=Episode 15=

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.080
My lord,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.360
walls have ears.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.280
Well...

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.640
Well...

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.800
Why are you here?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.560
Your Highness?

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.680
You've met?

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.360
Recently, people in my mansion fell ill.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.520
This physician miraculously cured them.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.920
Good that you know each other.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.360
Master Shentu's medical skills
are unparalleled.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.920
Have you treated madness before?

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.360
Where's the patient now?

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.040
I must check the pulse

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.360
to diagnose the condition.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.880
She's in the mansion.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560
Please come with me.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.480
Can the patient be brought here?

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:23.320
I...

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.200
I need to stay with the one
I need to stay with.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.560
Understood.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.680
What a devoted couple.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:32.320
You're truly...

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.760
Then I'll bring the patient here.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.160
She's mad.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.880
Is it treatable?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.000
It's beyond cure.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.960
Then in your expert opinion,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.880
how credible are a madwoman's words?

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.416
Master Shentu?

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.160
None can be trusted.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.440
But one thing is certain.

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.960
Her madness comes from poison.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.040
Poisoned?

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.480
Because her madness stems from poison,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.840
it's incurable.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.680
The only way to know more
about her madness

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.720
is to find the poisoner.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.960
This poison manifests

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.120
within 2 to 3 days.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.720
2 to 3 days...

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.520
She was still in the mansion then.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.280
Someone from the mansion?

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.320
Thank you so much.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.240
Anything else?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.760
Then we'll take our leave.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.440
One more thing!

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:07.360
See no evil.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.320
See no evil.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.040
Are you meeting your lover here?

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.440
You ask what you already know.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.680
Didn't you see it yourself?

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.680
Eyes can be deceived.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.080
Now you hear my confession.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.000
That can't be fake, right?

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.800
As the Perfect said just now,

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.520
hear no evil,

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.240
and see no evil.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:42.360
Must you linger

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.120
to offend others?

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.040
What if I insist on offending?

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.120
Let her go.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.000
She's part of my household.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.720
Official documents await.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.440
I'll leave.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.520
She belongs only to herself.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.800
Not to anyone.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.960
I belong solely to myself.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.760
Go.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.280
Let's go back.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.600
You're carrying Prince Rui's child?

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.640
Indeed.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.640
So I'm your elder.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.720
You...

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.840
You insist on propriety

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.640
and bid me keep it.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.800
But is this

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.400
what propriety looks like?

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:59.040
Who are you?

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.600
What's your real purpose in coming here?

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.720
Full of plots...

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.960
Endless schemes...

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.160
Lies upon lies...

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.320
Even a secret lover.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.640
If you're so wanton

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.040
and stirring chaos in the mansion,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.720
why not use me?

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.360
You know my feelings.

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.920
If I bear Prince Rui's heir,

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:37.000
you'll be expelled.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.440
Your status

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.680
and position...

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.120
What's worth being used?

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.040
Is that truly so?

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:53.600
Yet why

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.880
do your eyes resemble those

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.880
of that purest, most innocent

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.960
and fearless woman?

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:11.440
You mean Xu Ziyi?

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.160
Not her.

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:17.640
She's a fake,

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:20.680
and so are you,

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.600
right?

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.080
I have something to do.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.960
You should leave.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.680
Tonight's game isn't over yet.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.920
What's going on?

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.960
What's going on?

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.760
What's this blood? Where's our daughter?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.280
What's going on?

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.320
What's going on?

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.320
Xu Ziyi learned that the Luos survived.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.000
As expected, she couldn't stay idle.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.800
Now I need my uncle and aunt
to identify Xu Ziyi.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:42.000
They can't die.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.480
Wait here.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.920
I'll handle this.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.520
It-It's you?

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.640
You actually survived.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.320
You're trying to silence us.

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:13.920
Attack.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:26.520
Go!

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.040
Go.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.320
Let's go.

00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.400
M-My money...

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.000
What money?

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.160
The money I took from the mansion.

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.200
Money? Well...

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:57.440
Hurry, attack!

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.440
Go now.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.760
My lady, what should we do?

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.040
