00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:48.640
Xu Ran

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:49.879
It's me.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.959
I’d like to meet with the investor.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.200
Mr. Ma

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.680
About last time—

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.000
Lu Ming said something inappropriate in the heat of the moment.

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.159
And then,

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.159
You know how artists can be.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.080
Sometimes they speak without thinking.

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.639
He really regretted it afterward.

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.840
He kept calling me.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.919
He insisted I bring him here.

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.039
So he could apologize to you in person.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.719
So, you see—

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:35.360
I’m sorry, Mr. Ma.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.280
I was too narrow-minded.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.159
I couldn’t accept criticism.

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.000
I offended you.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.479
I’m sorry.

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:50.759
Actually,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.039
It’s not really the artist’s fault.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.639
Maybe I talked too much last time.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.319
So this time,

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.319
I’ll keep quiet.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.759
Let me—

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.560
Let me.

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.040
Xu Xin

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.439
Come here for a moment.

00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.959
What do you think of this painting?

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.160
I spent a month working on it.

00:04:49.959 --> 00:04:51.199
I think it’s pretty good.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.199
Let me tell you a secret.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.199
It’s actually just a pile of trash.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:04.600
Out of everything I’ve ever painted,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.480
this is the most vulgar and the worst.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.639
But here’s the funny part.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:10.319
You know what?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.560
Xu Ran already sold it.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.560
And for a really high price.

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:27.240
If you’re not happy with it,

00:05:28.519 --> 00:05:29.720
why are you asking me?

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.680
Yeah.

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.480
If you think it’s good,

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.720
then maybe it is good.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.439
Do you think I don’t understand any of this?

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:51.160
Or that I can’t understand you?

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.040
You think all I ever do

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:57.600
is dance around

00:05:58.079 --> 00:05:59.040
and read books, right?

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.680
I don’t know.

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.360
I can’t tell what’s good

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:15.600
or what’s bad anymore.

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.519
Do you remember?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.680
I used to love going to exhibitions.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.800
Because that was something I truly enjoyed.

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.800
But now I don’t go anymore.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.040
Do you know why?

00:06:36.399 --> 00:06:38.160
When I see others paint better than me,

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:40.920
I feel really down.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.240
Why can he paint so well?

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.439
Is it because I’m not good enough?

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:54.360
But when I see others paint worse than me,

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:57.680
I feel even worse.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.959
How can a piece of trash still be above me?

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:14.800
Lu Ming

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.800
Are you under too much pressure?

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.639
I’m perfectly fine.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.480
I’m perfectly fine.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:48.679
Doctor

00:08:48.879 --> 00:08:49.480
My wife

00:08:50.279 --> 00:08:51.399
Why did I lose my child?

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.279
Miscarriage in the early months of pregnancy is common.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.879
Because this is considered the early pregnancy stage.

00:08:57.039 --> 00:08:58.080
The embryo is still unstable.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.159
It’s very easy for a miscarriage to happen.

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.759
I just want to know

00:09:00.759 --> 00:09:02.440
why I lost my child.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:04.879
Hormonal factors

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.360
Environmental factors

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.159
Genetic factors

00:09:07.679 --> 00:09:09.720
Or issues with the immune system

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.519
And at the time it happened,

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.120
you didn’t get medical help right away.

00:09:14.759 --> 00:09:16.799
Otherwise, the pregnancy might have been saved.

00:10:40.679 --> 00:10:41.320
I'm back.

00:10:44.879 --> 00:10:46.080
Xu Xin, do you know what happened?

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:50.919
I closed a huge deal today.

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.399
We’ll be able to move out of here soon.

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.320
What did you do at home today?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.440
Nothing much.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.200
I know what you're thinking.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.200
I was just looking at the window.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.320
Is the window nice?

00:11:23.159 --> 00:11:26.919
It’s still the same as always.

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.440
You know,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:45.120
I think

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.120
we could take a road trip to the seaside.

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:52.919
A change of scenery.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.559
Maybe it would be good for us.

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:25.080
For this exhibition to go smoothly,

00:12:25.519 --> 00:12:27.519
I must first thank Mr. Ma from Tianzhong Group

00:12:27.639 --> 00:12:28.679
for his strong support.

00:12:29.279 --> 00:12:30.120
Without him,

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:31.519
I wouldn’t be where I am today.

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:34.320
I also want to thank my partner

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.200
and agent, Xu Ran.

00:12:36.759 --> 00:12:38.200
He organized this exhibition.

00:12:39.159 --> 00:12:40.200
It’s all part of my job.

00:12:40.679 --> 00:12:42.960
Thank you to all the journalists for coming today.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:45.799
And the person I’m most grateful to,

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.320
who couldn’t be here today due to health reasons,

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.279
is absent from the event.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.559
She is my beloved wife,

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:51.600
Xu Xin.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:52.759
May I ask, Mr. Lu Ming,

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.559
what do you wish to express with this exhibition?

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:59.639
I want to express that in this digital age,

00:12:59.879 --> 00:13:02.440
creators are fighting against the phenomenon of appreciating the ugly.

00:13:02.799 --> 00:13:03.879
Can I interpret this as

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:05.879
another instance of you leveraging public sentiment

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:07.759
for a successful commercial strategy?

00:13:08.159 --> 00:13:08.879
As far as I know,

00:13:08.919 --> 00:13:10.600
the themes of your works in recent years

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:12.320
have consistently tapped into

00:13:12.399 --> 00:13:13.480
hot social topics.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:15.600
Combined with short video marketing,

00:13:15.759 --> 00:13:16.679
they have sparked

00:13:16.679 --> 00:13:18.360
quite a bit of debate and reaction.

00:13:18.559 --> 00:13:19.480
Some say your works

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:21.360
are prime examples of successful commodification.

00:13:21.799 --> 00:13:22.679
Others say

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.440
you are exploiting public emotions

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:25.840
to stir up social division,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.399
losing the essence of art.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.039
What’s your view on this?

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:29.960
Whose comments?

00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:30.960
Some critics.

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.000
My response to that

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.919
is to suggest they take a piece of paper,

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.679
write down all their opinions about my work,

00:13:38.679 --> 00:13:39.559
put it all down,

00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:41.720
then shove it in their mouths and swallow it.

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:45.559
And then go on living their miserable lives.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.240
Because no one

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.320
cares about their comments.

00:13:48.679 --> 00:13:49.759
So you mean

00:13:49.759 --> 00:13:51.559
you don’t accept any outside criticism?

00:13:52.279 --> 00:13:53.879
My work is simply my personal expression.

00:13:54.159 --> 00:13:55.120
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

00:13:57.639 --> 00:13:58.399
Even so,

00:13:58.799 --> 00:14:00.120
it’s the recognition from the industry

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.799
that brought you to where you are today.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:04.200
But I don’t need their approval.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:05.720
Even so,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.519
you still benefit from public opinion.

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:08.919
Positive comments from the public

00:14:08.919 --> 00:14:11.080
have brought you fame and fortune.

00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:13.000
But at the same time, you can’t accept

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.519
the negative impact of public opinion.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:16.639
Isn’t that a bit of a double standard?

00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.200
This reporter’s question

00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.559
is a bit too one-sided.

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:21.639
Mr. Lu’s works and creative process

00:14:21.879 --> 00:14:23.279
have always stayed true to their original intent.

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:24.399
Consistent from start to finish.

00:14:24.679 --> 00:14:25.600
He never considers

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.879
the factors you mentioned.

00:14:27.799 --> 00:14:29.039
Let me tell everyone something.

00:14:29.399 --> 00:14:30.240
Just now,

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.320
Mr. Lu’s "归处"

00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:34.960
was sold for a sky-high price at auction.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.080
This is a major event for our art world,

00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.000
bringing honor and recognition to us all.

00:14:39.799 --> 00:14:40.759
Wouldn’t you all agree?

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:45.279
Congratulations.

00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:46.840
Your work sold really well this time.

00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:49.120
We’re going to make a good profit again.

00:14:51.879 --> 00:14:52.639
What’s wrong?

00:14:52.919 --> 00:14:53.600
You don’t seem happy.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.000
Is it because of that reporter just now?

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.480
Don’t take it to heart.

00:14:59.799 --> 00:15:00.480
You know,

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:03.159
you need to start working on your next piece soon.

00:15:03.159 --> 00:15:04.720
I’ve got a long list of orders waiting.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.759
Everyone’s waiting for you.

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.240
Xu Ran.

00:15:08.159 --> 00:15:09.399
I want to take a break for a while.

00:15:09.879 --> 00:15:11.240
Take a break? Now?

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:12.039
Lu Ming.

00:15:12.399 --> 00:15:14.639
Time is money right now.

00:15:15.039 --> 00:15:15.879
It’s because of Xu Xin.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:18.679
She hasn’t been doing well lately.

00:15:18.919 --> 00:15:19.720
I want to spend some time with her.

00:15:20.519 --> 00:15:21.879
She still hasn’t recovered.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:25.679
That’s true.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.080
Lu Ming.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.639
About what happened...

00:15:28.679 --> 00:15:29.559
It really was an accident.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.840
Try to comfort her.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:34.919
Mr. Xu.

00:15:37.399 --> 00:15:38.120
Mr. Lu.

00:15:39.919 --> 00:15:40.759
Ms. Lin Qing.

00:15:41.759 --> 00:15:42.720
Let me introduce you.

00:15:43.039 --> 00:15:45.919
This is a well-known writer in our field,

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:47.080
Ms. Lin Qing.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:47.960
Hello.

00:15:48.879 --> 00:15:49.399
Hello.

00:15:49.399 --> 00:15:50.080
Mr. Lu.

00:15:50.639 --> 00:15:52.559
Mr. Lu is the rising star of our art world.

00:15:52.879 --> 00:15:53.600
I’ve heard so much about you.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:56.000
The way you express love in your work

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:56.759
—I really admire it.

00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.799
All my inspiration comes from my wife.

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.279
I’ve heard that before.

00:16:01.399 --> 00:16:03.559
People say you and your wife have a wonderful relationship.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.080
You’re considered the perfect couple in our circle.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.600
Everyone envies you two.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.320
Ms. Lin, you’re also very famous.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:10.159
I’ve heard about you as well.

00:16:10.799 --> 00:16:12.799
And what have you heard about me?

00:16:12.799 --> 00:16:14.240
I’ve long heard that your art criticism

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.600
is highly respected.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:16.919
Those you’ve interviewed

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.600
have all gained much more recognition.

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:21.480
You flatter me.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.159
It’s only because they’re talented.

00:16:23.279 --> 00:16:23.919
But,

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:27.080
Ms. Lin is known for her sharp words.

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:29.200
She never holds back.

00:16:29.559 --> 00:16:31.320
Some people’s reputations have suffered because of it.

00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.720
I just report what I see and hear,

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:36.039
and express it honestly.

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:39.639
So, Mr. Lu, do you have the courage

00:16:39.639 --> 00:16:41.039
to accept an exclusive interview with us?

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.000
That’s a great opportunity.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:43.039
Lu Ming.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.000
You have no idea

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.279
how many artists

00:16:45.679 --> 00:16:47.879
are eager for an interview with Ms. Lin Qing.

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:49.799
Well, Ms. Lin,

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.519
let me discuss it with my agent.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.399
I’ll be waiting for your reply.

00:16:54.399 --> 00:16:54.799
Alright.

00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:55.440
No problem.

00:17:11.039 --> 00:17:11.799
I’m back.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.000
How was your day?

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:21.559
It was fine.

00:17:22.559 --> 00:17:23.400
Just like usual.

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:25.359
How about you?

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:27.880
Pretty good.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:30.559
By the way,

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:33.240
why didn’t you come to my solo exhibition’s closing?

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.480
I was a bit tired.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:40.640
That’s okay too.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.920
Congratulations.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.519
Let’s go have dinner.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:53.279
Let’s celebrate.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.400
Why are we eating at a place like this?

00:18:00.319 --> 00:18:01.119
Do you remember?

00:18:01.759 --> 00:18:02.519
This was the place

00:18:02.519 --> 00:18:04.000
we used to love coming to.

00:18:04.759 --> 00:18:06.160
Even the owner has changed now.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.200
Looks like it’s been renovated.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:12.519
Back then, we didn’t have any money.

00:18:13.359 --> 00:18:15.480
The portions here were big and cheap.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:16.519
Should we try

00:18:16.519 --> 00:18:17.559
if it still tastes the same?

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.519
Sure.

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.799
Xu Xin

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.720
How about we go somewhere else?

00:18:31.839 --> 00:18:32.480
What's wrong?

00:18:33.039 --> 00:18:34.160
Let's pick a nicer restaurant.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.720
No need.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.640
I think this place is fine.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.319
We used to eat at places like this because we were broke.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.160
But now we can afford better.

00:18:50.079 --> 00:18:52.640
But I still think this place is good.

00:18:55.359 --> 00:18:56.119
Let me take this call.

00:18:58.880 --> 00:18:59.839
Hello, Xu Ran.

00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:05.960
Okay.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.559
I'll head over now.

00:19:10.799 --> 00:19:11.319
Xu Xin

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:15.640
Let's go eat somewhere else.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.359
Xu Ran and some friends are eating nearby.

00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:19.440
Let's join them.

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160
Why don't you go ahead?

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:24.599
I'll eat here by myself.

00:19:28.839 --> 00:19:29.480
Suit yourself.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.960
Why did you suddenly ask me to come here?

00:20:41.599 --> 00:20:42.200
Lu Ming.

00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:45.200
I want to have a proper talk with you.

00:20:47.559 --> 00:20:49.440
Is there anything you want to say to each other?

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.640
I just feel like I’m wasting my time.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:55.799
Did you really bring me here just to talk?

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:56.960
Is that the real reason you asked me to come?

00:20:58.880 --> 00:21:00.480
But every time I try to talk to you,

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.319
you push me away.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.720
Because I feel

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.680
you don’t truly want to open up to me.

00:21:08.359 --> 00:21:09.440
I want to help you.

00:21:10.359 --> 00:21:11.839
But I don’t know what I should do.

00:21:16.599 --> 00:21:18.319
So all I can do is work hard.

00:21:18.319 --> 00:21:19.319
To give you a better life.

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:20.440
I really tried my best.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.240
But this isn’t what I want.

00:21:23.079 --> 00:21:24.200
Then what do you really want?

00:21:26.759 --> 00:21:28.000
I want you to come back.

00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:42.839
I don’t know what you mean.

00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.200
I’m right here with you.

00:21:46.839 --> 00:21:47.720
Right in front of you.

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:52.720
No.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.079
You’re not here.

00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:57.839
You’re in your gallery.

00:21:59.119 --> 00:22:00.599
In your studio.

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:03.559
On the TV screen.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.000
And me,

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.599
I’m left alone in this harsh reality.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:14.079
Ms. Xu.

00:22:14.559 --> 00:22:15.799
I know that two years ago,

00:22:15.799 --> 00:22:17.440
you had a miscarriage due to an accident.

00:22:27.039 --> 00:22:27.799
I’m very sorry.

00:22:29.519 --> 00:22:31.119
Is the distance between you

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.200
related to that miscarriage?

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:36.720
Have you talked about this issue?

00:22:43.400 --> 00:22:45.200
It’s a past we don’t want to mention.

00:23:08.319 --> 00:23:09.240
Why are you here?

00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.319
I have something important to tell you.

00:23:15.119 --> 00:23:16.400
How important must it be

00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.400
for you to come in person?

00:23:24.599 --> 00:23:26.079
It’s about me and Lu Ming.

00:23:28.359 --> 00:23:29.720
I knew it was because of him.

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:31.480
I’ve heard about it.

00:23:32.599 --> 00:23:33.799
He’s doing quite well.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.759
You two are living well.

00:23:36.119 --> 00:23:38.319
Your house must be several times bigger than this one.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.039
Mom, I’m home.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.759
Sis.

00:23:45.319 --> 00:23:46.519
Long time no see.

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.359
Mom.

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.160
You didn’t tell me Sis was coming.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:56.400
I could’ve come back earlier.

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.039
Hello, Xiao Geng.

00:24:02.119 --> 00:24:03.119
Since Sis is here,

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:04.319
I just bought groceries.

00:24:04.519 --> 00:24:05.519
Let’s have a meal together.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:09.839
Let’s eat.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:10.720
Come on.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:11.680
Let’s raise a glass together.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.559
Welcome home, Sis.

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:15.720
Sis, you should come back often.

00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.440
We all miss you.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.319
Where’s Uncle Geng?

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.440
Dad’s on a business trip.

00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.680
He’ll be back in two weeks.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.720
How have you been lately?

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.480
I’m doing well.

00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:35.880
And I’m going on blind dates.

00:24:36.279 --> 00:24:36.920
Yeah.

00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.920
During these dates,

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:40.599
everyone who’s met Mingran

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.680
is very satisfied.

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.279
Mom.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.279
Don’t say that.

00:24:43.559 --> 00:24:44.759
What’s there to be embarrassed about?

00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:47.200
Mom’s going to pick carefully for you.

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.759
See who’s worthy of you.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:50.319
Remember this,

00:24:50.559 --> 00:24:52.039
I’m doing all this for your own good.

00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.720
What would you like to ask?

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:01.920
I’ll answer everything I know.

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:03.880
Then how about

00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:06.440
we start by talking about your new work?

00:25:06.799 --> 00:25:07.279
Sure.

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.440
I recently released a new piece.

00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.680
It’s called 《谎言之城》.

00:25:10.839 --> 00:25:13.079
It’s about intentional

00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.160
and unintentional betrayal between people.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:17.119
The title is unique.

00:25:17.119 --> 00:25:18.279
The perspective is unique too.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.519
I poured all my effort into this work.

00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.200
I’d say it’s the piece I’m most proud of.

00:25:28.039 --> 00:25:29.880
When you talk about relationships between people,

00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:31.960
does that include you and your wife?

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:32.960
Yes.

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:34.599
How would you describe

00:25:34.599 --> 00:25:36.079
your relationship with your wife?

00:25:39.839 --> 00:25:41.279
I really like a line of poetry.

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:42.960
It goes, “Bound by hair as man and wife,”

00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:44.200
“in love and trust we abide.”

00:25:45.559 --> 00:25:48.359
I think it describes my wife and me

00:25:48.359 --> 00:25:49.200
better than anything else.

00:25:56.599 --> 00:25:57.119
Alright.

00:25:57.759 --> 00:25:58.759
Let’s settle on that.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:00.279
Let’s keep in touch.

00:26:05.079 --> 00:26:05.759
Xiao Sun,

00:26:06.359 --> 00:26:07.960
help me deliver something to Mr. Wang later.

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.960
I’ll call you when I need you to pick it up.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:12.720
It’ll be about three hours.

00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.200
Okay.

00:26:17.359 --> 00:26:18.400
Are you feeling better?

00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.119
Much better.

00:26:22.519 --> 00:26:23.960
I prepared some gifts for them.

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:24.839
They’re in the trunk.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.559
Don’t forget to take them.

00:26:25.759 --> 00:26:27.839
Everyone said you didn’t need to buy such expensive gifts.

00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:29.240
Don’t make people feel pressured.

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.680
It’s just a few small things.

00:26:30.759 --> 00:26:31.680
They’re not worth much.

00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.920
Xu Xin!

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.920
Long time no see.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.680
It’s been ages, really!

00:26:39.839 --> 00:26:40.799
You’ve lost weight again—come here.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:42.920
Thank you.

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:43.640
Fruit.

00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:45.039
It’s really fresh.

00:26:45.319 --> 00:26:46.759
You all should try some.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.680
You shouldn’t have.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.720
Xu Xin brought gifts for you too.

00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:52.519
It’s always so heartwarming when we meet.

00:26:52.519 --> 00:26:53.519
And you even bought me something.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:54.599
You’re too kind.

00:26:57.039 --> 00:26:58.000
It’s beautiful.

00:26:58.480 --> 00:26:59.160
Thank you.

00:27:00.759 --> 00:27:01.519
It’s settled then.

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.319
I’m treating everyone today.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.960
Lu Ming,

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.359
didn’t I say back in college

00:27:13.759 --> 00:27:14.880
you’d definitely make it?

00:27:16.319 --> 00:27:17.400
You’ve had too much to drink.

00:27:19.559 --> 00:27:23.279
I heard your art trading business

00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.200
is booming.

00:27:24.759 --> 00:27:27.160
Like that steel wool ball you made,

00:27:27.519 --> 00:27:29.640
the clay doll,

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:30.839
and the wooden cabin.

00:27:31.599 --> 00:27:32.200
Hey,

00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:34.400
can you give your buddies a few?

00:27:35.279 --> 00:27:37.960
I heard just one of those goes for five figures.

00:27:38.359 --> 00:27:39.920
Really? Come on, stop it.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:45.720
Come on, let’s drink.

00:27:46.119 --> 00:27:46.559
Cheers.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.319
Bottoms up!

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:47.839
Cheers!

00:27:59.119 --> 00:28:00.119
Are you guys alright?

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:01.799
We’re fine.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.000
That’s just how Chen Fei is.

00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.880
He talks nonsense when he’s drunk.

00:28:08.759 --> 00:28:09.359
By the way,

00:28:09.759 --> 00:28:11.200
are you still in touch with Xixi?

00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.559
You didn’t know?

00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:14.119
Xixi has gone abroad.

00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:16.640
We’re not in contact anymore.

00:28:22.279 --> 00:28:23.759
Sir, your balance is insufficient.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640
Not enough balance.

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:28.240
Let me check.

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:30.759
I’ll take care of it.

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:33.839
Who are you looking down on?

00:28:34.359 --> 00:28:36.079
I said I’m paying today.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:37.920
Xiao Yi,

00:28:38.119 --> 00:28:38.960
your credit card.

00:28:40.119 --> 00:28:41.200
Credit card.

00:28:41.319 --> 00:28:42.039
Hurry up.

00:28:43.079 --> 00:28:43.680
Alright.

00:28:44.119 --> 00:28:44.720
Swipe the card.

00:28:46.559 --> 00:28:47.039
Let’s go.

00:28:58.880 --> 00:28:59.640
Xiao Yi,

00:29:04.319 --> 00:29:05.559
take care of yourself.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.160
What do you think?

00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.680
Does Xiao Yi need our help?

00:29:19.319 --> 00:29:20.480
That’s their family matter.

00:29:21.039 --> 00:29:21.680
Let’s go home.
