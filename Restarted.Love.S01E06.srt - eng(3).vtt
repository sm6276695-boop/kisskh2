00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:40.680
Don't make a sound. Don't make a sound. Don't make a sound.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:45.680
I won't hurt you.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.079
I'm telling you, no matter the reason,

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.920
if you're with Yuan You,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.480
it won't end well.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.560
because he's a murderer.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.280
It's all spread out.

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.000
Here, right here.

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:20.280
Try another one, yeah.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.039
Do you also draw in Xiao Tangyuan's picture book?

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.319
Didn't I tell you already?

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.560
It's a way for us to communicate.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.159
Don't press too hard.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.080
What about those drawings I saw before?

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.479
He drew those himself.

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.599
I don't know why he draws them either.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.039
Yuan You.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.479
Why are you working here as a caregiver?

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.080
What do you mean by that?

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:07.159
I just mean,

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:09.479
you're clearly well-educated,

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:11.599
and

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.800
you know about psychology too.

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:15.439
So you're asking me

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:16.839
why I'm doing so poorly, right?

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:18.879
I just want to know more about you.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.680
Really?

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.800
But that's not how I see it.

00:04:29.959 --> 00:04:33.040
I talked to a good friend a couple of days ago.

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.040
I'm planning to move in with her.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.240
I won't trouble you anymore after that.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.040
Whatever you want.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.160
I find you quite interesting.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.959
You come and go as you please, huh?

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.319
Sorry.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.040
But I really appreciate you these past few days.

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.319
Yeah, you do seem grateful.

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:34.360
You sure thank me a lot.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.000
I'm actually a bit flattered.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:37.240
Yuan You.

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:39.959
I don't know why you're acting like this.

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:41.600
But I'm sincere.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:43.680
Oh, come on.

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.439
Just like I said when I first met you,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.199
you get bored after a couple of days here.

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:50.360
I told you this before.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:51.879
Instead of acting like this from the start,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.120
you might as well not show up at all.

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.399
Don't give others false hope.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.680
Yuan You.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:01.279
You have no idea what I've been through.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.560
True, I don't know.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.160
But I don't care to know either.

00:06:04.839 --> 00:06:06.600
Go ahead and play your puzzle games.

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:08.800
But do you know what I think?

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:10.560
Maybe all of this

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.120
is just your imagination.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.399
We're the same, you and I.

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.279
So just stop overthinking.

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:36.879
Hey.

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:37.959
Is something up?

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:39.639
Hello, Xu Xin.

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.079
Do you have a moment?

00:06:42.839 --> 00:06:43.879
I have nothing to say.

00:06:44.199 --> 00:06:45.319
I don't want to be interviewed.

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.600
Wait.

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.519
What about Lu Ming?

00:06:51.959 --> 00:06:52.759
You don't want to hear about him either?

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.439
Funny coincidence,

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:00.680
I happened to be here a couple of days ago.

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.480
I ran into your husband, Lu Ming.

00:07:02.959 --> 00:07:04.079
He mentioned

00:07:04.879 --> 00:07:06.439
a lot about your relationship.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:08.839
What did he say?

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.519
If he talks about you to others,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:13.839
what do you think he'd say?

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.839
We're both women.

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.560
Honestly, I can tell from your expression

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.800
that your marriage

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.199
is having serious problems.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.360
That's very different from the loving couple image he shows others.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:29.399
There's a big gap.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.959
Do you know why he does that?

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:36.600
Because keeping up your marriage

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.399
raises the price of his artwork.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:43.560
If it were me,

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.839
I'd be pretty upset.

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:47.879
After all, someone you once loved

00:07:48.879 --> 00:07:50.199
now only sees you

00:07:50.439 --> 00:07:52.519
as something to be sold to the highest bidder.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:56.000
A stepping stone to success.

00:07:57.399 --> 00:07:58.439
A pawn.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.480
Don't you feel used?

00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.680
So what do you really want?

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.600
I want you to tell me the truth.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.120
Then I'll tell the public.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.240
Let's expose him together.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:34.759
Miss Lin.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.399
I don't know why you're doing this,

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.879
but what happens between Lu Ming and me is our business.

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.960
No one else should judge us, good or bad.

00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:48.960
No matter what I've been through,

00:08:49.639 --> 00:08:51.759
I don't want the public prying into my life.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.200
So, sorry.

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.679
I have nothing to say.

00:08:59.679 --> 00:09:01.120
You don't have to answer right away.

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.000
You can take your time to think about it.

00:09:04.279 --> 00:09:05.639
You have my contact info.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.440
You can reach me anytime.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:09.440
I've already paid for the bill.

00:09:10.679 --> 00:09:11.279
That's it.

00:09:12.679 --> 00:09:13.320
See you later.

00:09:22.639 --> 00:09:24.399
I told you, even if I'm not here,

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.919
you can handle things yourself.

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:27.519
But with you here,

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:29.000
I feel more at ease.

00:09:30.279 --> 00:09:32.679
Why do you look like you've just come back from a war?

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.600
Maybe it's because

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.440
I've been through a lot lately.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.399
So I'm a bit tired.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.240
I know what can cheer you up.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.759
Why did you choose this job?

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.360
Because in a bar,

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.000
the bartender is the center of the world.

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:57.120
You know, every bartender

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.720
mixes drinks based on their mood that day

00:09:58.879 --> 00:10:00.480
and the different customers they meet.

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:02.120
So every drink is unique.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:04.200
And every customer who tastes it

00:10:04.879 --> 00:10:06.679
embarks on a brand new adventure.

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.240
This job isn't easy at all.

00:10:10.039 --> 00:10:12.440
A bartender is actually a bit like a chemist.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.200
They know the flavors of every liquor

00:10:15.559 --> 00:10:17.399
and how they blend together.

00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:20.080
That's how you get the drink in front of you.

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:29.919
Try it.

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:39.559
Do you like it?

00:10:41.639 --> 00:10:42.360
I do.

00:10:43.159 --> 00:10:43.919
What's it called?

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:47.360
It's called Cup of Butterflies.

00:10:48.159 --> 00:10:49.320
I knew you'd like it.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:52.759
Because

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.039
I know you better than anyone else in this world.

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:29.200
This is my friend's apartment, used as a guesthouse.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:31.759
It's perfect for you to stay temporarily.

00:11:32.399 --> 00:11:33.080
It's nice.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.919
How much is it? I'll transfer the money to you.

00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.519
You're so annoying.

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.440
Do we really need to talk about money between us?

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.879
Don't worry.

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:41.639
Stay as long as you want.

00:11:44.679 --> 00:11:45.879
Thank you, Xi Xi.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.279
Silly.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.879
Whose call is that?

00:11:58.399 --> 00:12:00.080
It's so late. What if it's something urgent?

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:01.159
You answer it.

00:12:05.559 --> 00:12:06.000
Hello?

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:07.240
Xiao Tangyuan is missing.

00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.320
Is he with you?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:10.879
Yuan You.

00:12:11.639 --> 00:12:12.919
Why did you call me here so late?

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:15.200
Did you take Xiao Tangyuan?

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:16.879
What do you mean?

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:19.879
I put Xiao Tangyuan to bed tonight.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.360
But when I checked the rooms just now,

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.879
he was the only one missing from his room.

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:25.919
After I left this afternoon,

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:27.879
I haven't seen him since.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.279
Xiao Tangyuan wouldn't go with a stranger.

00:12:30.679 --> 00:12:31.840
Everyone he trusts is here.

00:12:35.639 --> 00:12:36.720
No matter the reason,

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.279
being with Yuan You

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.519
will never end well.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:42.519
Because he's a murderer.

00:12:44.279 --> 00:12:44.840
What's wrong?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.080
You've been acting strange all day.

00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:54.360
Last night, right here,

00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600
a man

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.000
told me not to trust you.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:06.000
He also said

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.600
that you're a criminal.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.440
Was that man dressed all in black?

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.440
A bit shorter than me?

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:18.840
Chen Fei.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:20.519
He Jing.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.799
Watch all the kids closely.

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.159
I know who it is now.

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.519
Yuan You.

00:13:26.799 --> 00:13:28.200
The one threatening you is Chen Fei.

00:13:28.799 --> 00:13:30.320
I think I know what he's planning and where he is.

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:32.320
Let him come after me later.

00:13:32.799 --> 00:13:33.919
Find a chance to get Xiao Tangyuan out.

00:13:57.039 --> 00:13:57.480
Nurse.

00:13:57.679 --> 00:13:58.240
Did you see

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.399
a man carrying a child just now?

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:00.039
Yes, I did.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:00.720
Where did they go?

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.480
He said he was taking the child

00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:03.600
to the rooftop to see the view.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:09.240
Chen Fei.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.120
Xiao Tangyuan, stay back.

00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:11.679
Calm down.

00:14:11.879 --> 00:14:12.519
Yuan You.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.080
You're here, acting like it's all fine,

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.639
playing house.

00:14:18.039 --> 00:14:19.639
Is this your imaginary wife?

00:14:23.039 --> 00:14:23.759
And this one

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.399
must be your son, right?

00:14:26.759 --> 00:14:27.279
Chen Fei.

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.279
Calm down.

00:14:28.679 --> 00:14:29.120
Don't.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.320
What right do you have to tell me to calm down?

00:14:33.919 --> 00:14:35.240
You're a murderer.

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.159
An executioner.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.639
You killed the girl I loved most.

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.720
You don't deserve to live.

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.320
If you have a problem, take it out on me.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:43.600
Put the child down first.

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.399
Put him down first.

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.559
Fine.

00:14:49.399 --> 00:14:50.679
Trying to bargain with me?

00:14:53.399 --> 00:14:54.759
Aren't you a psychologist?

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.080
I'll count to ten.

00:14:58.919 --> 00:14:59.759
Cure me.

00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.840
Or I'll throw him off.

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:08.240
Ten

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.679
Nine

00:15:13.919 --> 00:15:14.360
Eight

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:14.919
I know

00:15:15.879 --> 00:15:16.919
I know you blame me for what happened to Xiao Yi

00:15:16.919 --> 00:15:17.720
You put the blame on me

00:15:18.159 --> 00:15:19.720
But honestly, you blame yourself even more

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:20.360
Do you realize that?

00:15:21.159 --> 00:15:21.960
Seven

00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:23.840
Six

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.200
Alright, alright

00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:26.279
It's all my fault

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.519
Everything is my fault

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.080
I'll take responsibility for all the consequences

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:30.399
But the child is innocent

00:15:30.559 --> 00:15:31.440
Please put him down first

00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:32.519
Can you put him down first, please?

00:15:32.559 --> 00:15:33.240
Five

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.519
Chen Fei

00:15:35.039 --> 00:15:36.960
No matter what you do now, Xiao Yi won't come back

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:38.559
She'll never wake up, do you understand?

00:15:38.559 --> 00:15:39.159
Three

00:15:41.559 --> 00:15:43.120
Let me, let me

00:15:43.879 --> 00:15:44.759
Put him down

00:15:45.519 --> 00:15:46.279
Put him down first

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.440
Okay, just put him down first

00:15:49.159 --> 00:15:50.279
I'll die instead of him

00:15:51.159 --> 00:15:51.919
Put him down

00:15:52.519 --> 00:15:53.320
I'll do it

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.120
Yuan You

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.159
Alright

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.120
You do it

00:16:08.679 --> 00:16:09.279
Come here

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.039
Yuan You

00:16:50.639 --> 00:16:51.480
Get out of here.

00:17:38.319 --> 00:17:39.119
Why?

00:17:52.839 --> 00:17:53.759
Why?

00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960
Yuan You.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.759
Do you want to talk?

00:18:23.519 --> 00:18:24.359
Let's talk another time.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:53.839
It's so late, why are you here?

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:55.480
I was worried about you.

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.119
I brought you something.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.200
That's a lot.

00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:58.799
Come in, quickly.

00:19:08.039 --> 00:19:08.920
What are you thinking about?

00:19:09.319 --> 00:19:10.200
You seem distracted.

00:19:11.359 --> 00:19:12.960
I'm thinking about Lu Ming and me.

00:19:13.079 --> 00:19:14.640
What really happened between us?

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.920
So your relationship with Lu Ming—

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.680
When did the problems start?

00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.200
A long time ago.

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.440
Didn't you say you were fine?

00:19:28.359 --> 00:19:29.359
I was fine back then.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.559
But now, I'm really not.

00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.720
I was so looking forward to this dance show.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.599
You know that.

00:19:35.359 --> 00:19:37.279
Didn't I ask you when I booked the tickets?

00:19:37.799 --> 00:19:38.799
And now you're treating me like this.

00:19:38.839 --> 00:19:40.000
Do you think I want this?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.519
Do you think I enjoy going out for work every day?

00:19:43.039 --> 00:19:44.680
Do you think I don't want to come home every day?

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:46.000
Who do you think I'm doing this for?

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.200
I don't want you to live like that again.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.839
Like when we first got married.

00:19:50.079 --> 00:19:50.759
Lu Ming.

00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:52.279
Back then,

00:19:52.799 --> 00:19:54.279
Even though we squeezed into

00:19:54.279 --> 00:19:56.000
that shabby old rental every day,

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:57.640
and ate simple meals,

00:19:57.640 --> 00:19:58.559
I was happy.

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.200
But I wasn't happy living like that.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.759
I want you to have the life you have now.

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:11.680
I don't want you to worry about prices when you shop.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.359
I want you to stand tall in front of your mom.

00:20:15.359 --> 00:20:16.599
Hold your head high.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.319
So what are those hallucinations you mentioned?

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.319
I know what I'm saying

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:26.480
might be hard to believe.

00:21:27.359 --> 00:21:28.240
I believe you.

00:21:30.519 --> 00:21:32.960
I believe there's a reasonable explanation for all of this.

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.759
So you think all of this is connected to Lu Ming?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.960
Is there any way to prove it?

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:53.240
I like working late at night.

00:21:54.119 --> 00:21:54.960
After you go to sleep,

00:21:55.559 --> 00:21:56.759
I always go alone.

00:22:00.279 --> 00:22:02.319
Lu Ming often stays in the studio

00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.119
alone until late at night.

00:22:05.319 --> 00:22:06.960
But he never lets me in.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:11.000
If there's anywhere in the house to find clues,

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:13.599
it would be there.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:15.359
Then go check it out.

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.039
Lu Ming is going to an exhibition tomorrow.

00:22:21.279 --> 00:22:22.359
When he's not home,

00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:23.480
I'll go take a look.

00:22:27.759 --> 00:22:29.440
Are you sure Lu Ming isn't home today?

00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:32.039
He should be at the exhibition.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:35.920
Don't be afraid.

00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.119
Go ahead.

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:38.119
I'll keep watch for you here.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.559
If anyone comes,

00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:41.079
I'll be the first to stop them.

00:23:07.799 --> 00:23:09.039
Incorrect password.

00:23:16.279 --> 00:23:16.880
Do you know

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:19.519
what I remember most about this place?

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:21.799
What is it?

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:24.400
The restaurant just up ahead.

00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:26.559
That's where I proposed to you.

00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.799
October 15th.

00:23:31.359 --> 00:23:33.039
But you didn't say yes at the time.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:35.440
You said you needed to think about it.

00:23:36.559 --> 00:23:37.720
It was eleven days later.

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:40.359
October 26th.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.440
That day,

00:23:46.079 --> 00:23:47.440
I'll never forget for the rest of my life.

00:24:03.519 --> 00:24:04.640
Door unlocked.

00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:07.319
Just like the human heart,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.039
it hides many secret passages.

00:25:10.079 --> 00:25:11.519
Back then, I kept wishing,

00:25:11.799 --> 00:25:13.079
wondering who would do this to me.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.319
Wishing...

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.440
Was it Lu Ming?

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:30.119
Dr. Xu, why are you here?

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.960
You're in a very dangerous phase right now.

00:25:32.839 --> 00:25:34.200
If it's not handled properly,

00:25:34.759 --> 00:25:35.920
you could easily enter

00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.000
an irreversible stage.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:45.640
I should have realized sooner.

00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:48.720
How do you know my whereabouts so well?

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.240
So you two are working together.

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:53.079
Miss Xu, you've misunderstood.

00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.160
Mr. Lu is just very worried about you.

00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.920
He just asked me to pay special attention to you.

00:25:59.039 --> 00:25:59.680
Xu Xin.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:02.160
I'm just worried something might happen to you.

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.480
Special attention?

00:26:05.759 --> 00:26:07.039
Or is it something more?

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.119
All this time,

00:26:11.839 --> 00:26:13.200
I've never been able to tell

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.880
if what I see is real or just an illusion.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.880
Is it all because of your diagnosis, Dr. Xu?

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:21.240
So you already set up this trap for me.

00:26:21.799 --> 00:26:23.039
Just waiting for me to fall in.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:24.160
Xu Xin, please calm down.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.039
We're all trying our best to help you recover.

00:26:27.079 --> 00:26:28.079
You've given so much.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.759
If something happens to you now,

00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.400
have you thought about the consequences?

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:32.160
Trying?

00:26:33.039 --> 00:26:34.440
This is what you call trying?

00:26:35.039 --> 00:26:36.480
Trying to weave a perfect lie?

00:26:40.319 --> 00:26:41.680
Xi Xi was right.

00:26:43.839 --> 00:26:45.599
I never should have trusted anyone around me.

00:26:48.359 --> 00:26:50.680
I've always lived in the fantasy of loving and being loved.

00:26:53.559 --> 00:26:54.160
Your love

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.279
makes me feel suffocated.

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:02.039
Xu Xin.

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:03.240
Let go of me. I'm going to find Xi Xi.

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:03.680
Xu Xin.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:04.640
Let go of me.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.640
She's already dead.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.319
She died two years ago.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:16.039
We attended her memorial together.

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.799
Xu Xin.

00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.640
I won't believe anything you say.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:32.519
Xi Xi is waiting for me up ahead.

00:27:32.519 --> 00:27:33.039
Xu Xin.

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.559
Xu Xin, listen to me.

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:35.960
Xu Xin, Xi Xi is waiting for me just ahead.

00:27:36.319 --> 00:27:37.200
If you keep this up,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:38.279
I'll have to take action against you.

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:38.920
Xu Xin, listen to me.

00:27:39.079 --> 00:27:40.440
Let go of me!

00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.279
Let go of me!

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.279
I'm protecting you, do you understand?

00:28:48.799 --> 00:28:49.680
I'll take you somewhere.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:52.920
It's very safe there.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:54.240
No one knows about it.

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:30.200
Let's go.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.079
I used to live here when I was a child.

00:29:55.359 --> 00:29:56.400
Whenever it's peak season,

00:29:57.039 --> 00:29:58.039
I rent it out.

00:29:58.839 --> 00:29:59.960
So it's always kept clean.

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:03.599
From a colleague,

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:05.079
I borrowed some clothes for you.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:07.000
Come on.

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.559
The bedroom is next door.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.079
Xiao Tangyuan has a condition called Selective Mutism.

00:30:38.599 --> 00:30:39.960
It means children or adults

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.839
stay silent in situations where they need to speak.

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:42.559
They remain silent.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:45.160
Sometimes they can speak normally,

00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.960
but it's usually not a physical issue.

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.279
It's caused by anxiety and social difficulties.

00:30:53.839 --> 00:30:54.400
That's right.

00:30:54.599 --> 00:30:57.039
You were a psychologist too.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.279
So why did you bring Xiao Tangyuan

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:01.359
to see Xu Ran?

00:31:02.599 --> 00:31:03.759
Was it because of Xiao Yi?

00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:11.759
This matter

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.200
has weighed on my heart for a long time.

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.319
I never thought I'd tell anyone about it.

00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:21.000
I used to be a psychologist.

00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:23.519
Xiao Yi came to me for therapy.

00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:27.640
I'm Yuan You.

00:31:28.279 --> 00:31:29.160
How can I help you?

00:31:29.359 --> 00:31:30.039
Here's the situation.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.960
Xiao Yi was my fiancée.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:34.839
We were together for many years.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.319
I proposed to her.

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:37.519
But her parents

00:31:37.519 --> 00:31:38.880
were firmly against us being together.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.279
They kept telling Xiao Yi to leave me.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:42.759
Gradually,

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:46.319
I noticed Xiao Yi became emotionally unstable.

00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:49.079
She would suddenly cry and have outbursts.

00:31:55.079 --> 00:31:55.920
At first,

00:31:56.599 --> 00:31:58.400
she only had mild depression.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:01.200
But Xiao Yi secretly asked me for help.

00:32:05.319 --> 00:32:06.359
She said Chen Fei abused her.

00:32:07.799 --> 00:32:08.680
He hit her every day.

00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:10.920
It became routine.

00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.119
It's not that she didn't want to leave him.

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.880
They'd been together since college.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:18.480
Later, because of Chen Fei,

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.000
she cut ties with her parents.

00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.920
At first, Xiao Yi tried to escape.

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:26.039
But later, she couldn't leave anymore.

00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:28.319
He hit her every day.

00:32:29.279 --> 00:32:30.200
She couldn't fight back.

00:32:31.559 --> 00:32:32.319
Dr. Yuan,

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:34.160
I'm begging you.

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.200
Please help me.

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.319
I understand how you feel.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:44.680
And your situation.

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:47.240
But I can only do what's within my duty.

00:32:48.279 --> 00:32:49.839
I hope you'll seek help from the authorities.

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:52.880
I'm really not

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:54.200
a qualified psychologist.

00:32:55.279 --> 00:32:56.519
I assumed from the start

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.480
that it was all her imagination.

00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.359
So I asked Chen Fei about it.

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:04.599
After Chen Fei found out,

00:33:05.799 --> 00:33:07.319
he treated Xiao Yi even worse at home.

00:33:08.119 --> 00:33:09.359
It started with a slap,

00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:11.680
then he used a belt.

00:33:15.599 --> 00:33:17.839
I still can't forget

00:33:17.839 --> 00:33:19.839
how Xiao Yi looked when she left our hospital.

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.599
She stared at me intensely.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:24.240
She didn't say a word.

00:33:25.119 --> 00:33:26.599
But my heart felt

00:33:26.599 --> 00:33:27.400
like it was pierced.

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:31.720
It hurt so much.

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:34.519
And I felt suffocated.

00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.640
Then she jumped from the building.

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:42.839
Right outside my window.

00:33:52.039 --> 00:33:53.000
Before the ambulance arrived,

00:33:54.119 --> 00:33:56.200
she never closed her eyes.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.759
Her eyes were full of hatred

00:33:59.359 --> 00:34:00.240
and resentment.

00:34:01.799 --> 00:34:02.680
I was the one who hurt her,

00:34:04.359 --> 00:34:05.200
along with Chen Fei.

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:30.840
Since then,

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:33.599
every time I enter the clinic,

00:34:33.599 --> 00:34:35.079
I remember Xiao Yi's face.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.480
Gradually,

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.360
I became afraid to treat anyone.

00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.719
So I left the clinic.

00:34:46.119 --> 00:34:47.760
I came to the welfare center to be with the children.

00:34:49.679 --> 00:34:50.599
Until I met you.

00:35:53.559 --> 00:35:54.559
Where did you go?
