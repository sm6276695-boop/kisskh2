00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.359
I believe everyone here

00:01:15.519 --> 00:01:17.760
has, since childhood, whether from books

00:01:17.959 --> 00:01:19.599
the stage, or the big screen,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.799
been exposed to many classic masterpieces.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.959
And you all have different perspectives.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.400
Who would like to share their thoughts?

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:30.640
I’m sure everyone

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.400
is tired of hearing Xu Xin’s opinions.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:34.840
This student here,

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:37.680
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:39.799
Yes.

00:01:40.519 --> 00:01:41.200
Please share your view.

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.120
I really like the female protagonist

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.159
as portrayed in this story.

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.239
I also appreciate the core of the story.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.680
Only two independent souls

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.359
are worthy of love.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:58.799
But I have a different perspective.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.560
From the story’s point of view,

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.200
it is indeed a romance novel.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.040
But from the female protagonist’s perspective,

00:02:06.519 --> 00:02:07.959
it’s actually a horror story.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.280
From the author’s perspective,

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.000
we can see the male protagonist

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.520
struggling within the marriage.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.639
In this marriage,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.759
both his body and soul are hurt.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.240
This is a personal tragedy.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:23.240
It’s also a tragedy of the times.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.199
I do agree with that.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:28.000
However,

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.560
in this marriage doomed to tragedy,

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.000
both are victims.

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.479
The male protagonist has forever lost

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:36.120
the chance to see the world again.

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.879
And his wife has lost even more—everything.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.960
I hope such tragedies never happen again.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.719
Why does this girl look so much like you?

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.159
It's not just similar. That's actually me.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.479
Lu Ming.

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.400
I remember now.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.240
He's the guy from Professor Zhong's class

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.840
who discussed novels with you.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.000
You know him?

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.400
He's a top student at the art academy.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.879
He hasn't even graduated and he's already won many awards.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.080
You're probably the only one who doesn't know him.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:56.520
Did you know he used your image for this?

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.479
Isn't that going too far?

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:04.680
Hey, classmate.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.560
You're Lu Ming, right?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.479
Yes.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.120
Do you realize what you did is illegal?

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.439
Sorry, I sent you an email.

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:16.879
But you didn't reply.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:18.240
What email?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.360
Even if you sent me an email,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.000
without my permission,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.560
using my image without consent

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.480
is still not okay.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.279
This is my fault.

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:37.560
I'm sorry.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.279
Is just apologizing enough?

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:43.759
You should at least treat me to a meal.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.480
Wouldn't that show you're sincere?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.439
So,

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.560
why did you

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.800
put me in your work?

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:56.680
My teacher told me

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.759
inspiration comes in a flash.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.600
At the time, I didn't know why

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.040
I wanted to capture you.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.920
Next time, let me know in advance.

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:14.439
Dinner?

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:16.000
Sure.

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:06.519
You're up.

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.240
I made you breakfast.

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:15.000
Did you have a nightmare last night?

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.839
It's nothing.

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.600
Okay.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.920
Lu Ming.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.839
I want to find time to visit Professor Zhong again.

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.519
Professor Zhong.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.920
The one who taught us in college.

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.399
Why do you want to see him?

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:43.360
We're meeting Professor Zhong today.

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.040
We haven't seen him much since graduation.

00:06:45.199 --> 00:06:46.360
We set this up a few days ago.

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:54.839
I know this sounds strange.

00:06:56.959 --> 00:06:59.399
But I want to see him again.

00:07:02.319 --> 00:07:03.360
Let's wait until I have time.

00:07:13.519 --> 00:07:15.480
You came alone? Where's your wife?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.959
Dr. Xu, let's get straight to the point.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.959
Xu Xin has started to remember

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:23.279
some things from before.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560
Didn't you promise me

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.079
you could stop all this from happening?

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.680
I told you

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.879
this takes time.

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.720
Why are you doing this?

00:07:47.399 --> 00:07:48.240
What's your reason?

00:07:55.879 --> 00:07:56.920
Do you think you love her?

00:07:58.959 --> 00:08:00.240
In this world,

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.800
no one could love her more than I do.

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.240
We're meeting Professor Zhong today.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.759
We haven't seen him much since graduation.

00:08:15.759 --> 00:08:16.160
Xiao Lu.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.800
We arranged this a few days ago.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.240
The one who taught us in college.

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:19.279
Why do you want to see him?

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.200
Who are you looking for?

00:09:03.919 --> 00:09:05.720
Excuse me, is Professor Zhong home?

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.000
You have the wrong place.

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.120
Wait.

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:10.279
But I was just here yesterday.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:12.679
I've lived here for five years.

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:29.919
Hello.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.720
Do you know where Yuan You is?

00:09:35.919 --> 00:09:36.600
He's over there.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:54.320
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:57.320
Are you drawing?

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.759
Looks like you really do come here often.

00:10:08.879 --> 00:10:10.080
So should we...

00:10:11.679 --> 00:10:13.159
talk about what happened that night?

00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:18.519
So who was that man that night?

00:10:19.039 --> 00:10:20.679
Why did he do that to you?

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:26.919
It's none of your business.

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.840
Then what do you want to talk to me about?

00:11:01.879 --> 00:11:02.799
Xiao Tangyuan

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.279
Why did you draw this?

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:07.759
Did you see something?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.960
Xu Xin

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:58.519
Why are you here?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.320
I came to take you home.

00:12:01.399 --> 00:12:02.720
How did you know I was here?

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.840
Did you forget?

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:07.240
I have your location on my phone.

00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.720
If I can't find you,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.480
it tells me where you are.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:16.039
When did you install this for me?

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.519
You asked me to install it.

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:21.240
You told me

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.639
it would make you safer when you're out.

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:25.600
This was before the accident.

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:27.240
You might not remember.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.039
I don't remember.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.919
But I think

00:12:37.759 --> 00:12:39.639
I wouldn't have let you install something like that.

00:12:42.519 --> 00:12:43.840
I don't want this.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.159
Please uninstall it for me.

00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:45.799
Xu Xin

00:12:45.919 --> 00:12:47.039
Please uninstall it right now.

00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.840
What's wrong?

00:12:54.919 --> 00:12:55.639
I remember you.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:12:59.440
We met at the psychology clinic, right?

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:05.240
Xu Xin

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:07.600
Is this your friend?

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.519
My name is Yuan You.

00:13:13.279 --> 00:13:14.480
She often comes here to see the kids.

00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:15.919
That's why I recognize her.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.440
Xu Xin

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:26.919
Let's go home.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.679
Don't go to that welfare home anymore.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.000
Lu Ming, you just don't understand.

00:14:26.639 --> 00:14:28.120
I can't explain it to you.

00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:29.799
I really saw someone get killed.

00:14:30.919 --> 00:14:31.919
It's all in your imagination.

00:14:32.159 --> 00:14:34.320
No, this isn't a hallucination.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:36.039
Xiao Tangyuan's drawing.

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:36.759
Xu Xin.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Stop using your fantasies as an excuse.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.080
Don't think I don't know you went to the welfare home.

00:14:51.799 --> 00:14:52.840
I know what you're really doing there.

00:14:58.759 --> 00:14:59.799
What are you talking about?

00:15:07.799 --> 00:15:08.840
That male caregiver.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.559
When he stands next to you,

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:15.080
I feel like an outsider.

00:15:25.639 --> 00:15:26.279
Lu Ming.

00:15:29.039 --> 00:15:30.159
Why would you think that?

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:34.679
Let's eat.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.679
I can't eat anymore.

00:15:58.559 --> 00:15:59.519
Then don't eat.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.360
From now on,

00:16:03.399 --> 00:16:04.639
don't go to the welfare home anymore.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:49.200
Hello.

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:51.440
I'm Lin Qing, a reporter from Art Digest.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:52.880
You're Lu Ming's wife.

00:17:54.839 --> 00:17:56.440
My husband isn't home today.

00:17:56.759 --> 00:17:58.279
Maybe you could come another day.

00:17:58.799 --> 00:17:59.759
I'm not here for him.

00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:01.160
I'm here specifically to see you.

00:18:02.759 --> 00:18:03.599
Reporter Lin.

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.119
Please have some tea.

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:07.680
Thank you. Just call me Lin Qing.

00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.319
I'll start recording now.

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:15.799
My husband isn't home.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.279
I'm not sure what I can say.

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:24.160
Actually, this is my first time talking to a reporter.

00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:26.000
It's okay, don't be so nervous.

00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.359
Let's just have a casual chat.

00:18:28.079 --> 00:18:31.000
At your husband's recent exhibition closing,

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.480
I heard you were supposed to attend.

00:18:32.839 --> 00:18:34.079
But you weren't feeling well,

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:35.480
so you couldn't make it, right?

00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.000
I was in a car accident not long ago.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:46.079
So my memory is still a bit confused.

00:18:47.279 --> 00:18:50.279
And I'm afraid going out would trouble him.

00:18:51.279 --> 00:18:52.720
You mentioned confusion.

00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.079
Does that mean between you two,

00:18:55.079 --> 00:18:56.960
some unpleasant things from before,

00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.240
you've forgotten them all?

00:18:59.359 --> 00:19:00.400
Unpleasant?

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:08.319
Sorry.

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.680
I really have forgotten a lot.

00:19:14.799 --> 00:19:15.720
It's actually not so bad.

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.200
Many people try hard to forget things,

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:20.480
but you forgot because of the accident.

00:19:21.039 --> 00:19:23.279
I guess it's a blessing in disguise.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.000
So, the unpleasantness you mentioned,

00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:29.119
were you referring to something specific?

00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:33.440
No, I just meant unpleasantness in general.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:36.680
In married life, between husband and wife,

00:19:36.839 --> 00:19:38.359
it's normal to have some friction.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.279
Come on.

00:19:59.559 --> 00:20:00.279
Keep drawing.

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.599
Xiao Tangyuan's condition has greatly improved.

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:13.440
Thank you.

00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:15.039
You give the children free sessions every week.

00:20:15.039 --> 00:20:15.880
You provide psychological therapy.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.799
They really like you.

00:20:17.039 --> 00:20:17.759
You're welcome.

00:20:18.359 --> 00:20:20.279
Being able to use what I've learned

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.519
to help these children

00:20:21.839 --> 00:20:22.799
feels very meaningful to me.

00:20:23.839 --> 00:20:25.880
Mr. Yuan is very caring.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:27.640
He looks after so many children every day.

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:28.759
It's really hard work.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.200
It's just physical labor.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:36.720
Mr. Yuan seems to know a lot about psychology.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:38.079
He has deep expertise as well.

00:20:40.559 --> 00:20:41.880
You're not an ordinary caregiver.

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:44.440
Taking care of so many children at the welfare center

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.359
and doing it so well

00:20:45.759 --> 00:20:47.200
is no easy task.

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.160
So I started looking into Mr. Yuan.

00:20:52.359 --> 00:20:53.519
I did some research.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:56.079
I found out that Mr. Yuan

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.559
was once half a colleague of mine.

00:20:58.279 --> 00:20:59.440
But why is he now

00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:01.559
just a regular caregiver?

00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:06.839
Mr. Yuan, please don't misunderstand.

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.519
I'm just curious.

00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:10.240
Maybe Mr. Yuan

00:21:10.799 --> 00:21:12.440
has secrets he can't talk about.

00:21:20.119 --> 00:21:20.920
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.279
Let's go.

00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:23.160
Come on.

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.400
So after the accident,

00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.279
you really forgot a lot of things.

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:30.039
My recent memories are a bit blurry.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.359
But I remember earlier memories more clearly.

00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.680
Sometimes I wonder,

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.519
if I hadn't met him back then,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:43.240
what would things be like now?

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.880
Who knows?

00:22:45.279 --> 00:22:48.000
Maybe we’d still be pursuing dance together.

00:22:48.759 --> 00:22:50.680
Maybe working at some training center,

00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.960
teaching kids.

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:03.200
Hey, Lu Ming.

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.440
Where is this?

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.400
Weren’t you coming to see Professor Zhong?

00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:23.640
I asked classmates who still keep in touch with him.

00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:24.799
He lives here.

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:32.440
Isn’t Professor Zhong’s home in Building Four?

00:23:32.799 --> 00:23:33.799
What are you talking about?

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:35.559
Let’s go.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:06.559
Lu Ming

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.359
Come in

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:40.960
Have a seat.

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:42.000
Okay.

00:24:44.839 --> 00:24:47.920
Lu Ming, even though I'm just an adjunct teacher,

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:49.240
I didn't teach you many classes.

00:24:49.599 --> 00:24:52.440
But you've always left a deep impression on me.

00:24:53.119 --> 00:24:54.519
I've always thought

00:24:54.599 --> 00:24:56.759
you would achieve great things in the future.

00:24:57.359 --> 00:24:58.680
And I was right.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.960
Now you're already a renowned artist.

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.480
And you still respect your teachers so much.

00:25:04.599 --> 00:25:05.640
You even came to visit me.

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:07.839
Thank you both.

00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:10.799
You're too kind, Professor Zhong.

00:25:13.039 --> 00:25:13.920
Professor Zhong,

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:18.799
I didn't expect you'd changed so much.

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:21.200
Well, I've gotten old.

00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.440
No one can escape the passage of time.

00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.119
But I'm doing fine.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.400
I still have these old friends to keep me company.

00:25:30.519 --> 00:25:33.519
Xu Xin, I remember you as well.

00:25:33.839 --> 00:25:35.119
You attended quite a few of my classes too.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:40.799
Professor Zhong, may I ask you something?

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.000
Where is your wife?

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.680
I'm all alone.

00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:56.640
In the end, I chose not to get married.

00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.279
I think being alone is just fine.

00:26:01.519 --> 00:26:02.160
But...

00:26:04.599 --> 00:26:08.799
I heard you married a much younger woman.

00:26:12.599 --> 00:26:13.359
Her name is...

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.799
Xiao Ya.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.519
You must have heard wrong.

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:23.920
Lu Ming,

00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.880
Seeing you and Xu Xin so happy now,

00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.240
I'm truly happy for you.

00:26:29.119 --> 00:26:31.920
I think your relationship is as solid as a rock,

00:26:32.079 --> 00:26:33.440
and will last a thousand years.

00:26:36.759 --> 00:26:37.720
Thank you, Professor Zhong.

00:26:38.559 --> 00:26:40.160
Seeing how carefree you are now,

00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.200
I'm happy for you too.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.400
It seems those things from back then

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.400
no longer affect you.

00:26:51.599 --> 00:26:52.640
What things?

00:26:53.799 --> 00:26:55.759
The past is best left unspoken.

00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:56.599
Professor Zhong,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:26:58.960
I actually think that incident

00:26:59.519 --> 00:27:00.640
must have had more to it.

00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:03.880
A teacher as principled as you,

00:27:04.319 --> 00:27:05.519
how could you possibly have

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:06.960
an improper relationship with a female student?

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.839
Back then, a female student pursued me.

00:27:13.119 --> 00:27:14.160
I refused her.

00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:17.599
But then she turned it around on me.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.519
She told the school I was the one pursuing her.

00:27:20.119 --> 00:27:21.279
Just that trivial matter.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:24.240
The school really didn't get the facts straight.

00:27:24.519 --> 00:27:26.079
It was clearly the girl's fault.

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.119
Why were you the one punished?

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.119
Can we not talk about this anymore?

00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:35.920
Sorry, Professor Zhong.

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.319
It's just so nice to see you.

00:27:38.799 --> 00:27:39.759
I spoke too much.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:41.200
Please forgive me.

00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:46.960
Yes, I should be more forgiving.

00:27:47.359 --> 00:27:50.440
Young people today really do respect their teachers.

00:27:50.839 --> 00:27:52.839
You came to see me, but brought nothing.

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.839
We actually wanted to bring a gift.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.200
But we were in a rush.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.480
Professor Zhong, how about this—

00:28:02.519 --> 00:28:05.160
Let me transfer you some money as a token of thanks.

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:06.839
What are you saying?

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:07.799
Lu Ming,

00:28:10.519 --> 00:28:11.279
Do you want to...

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.079
I really don't understand

00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.279
why you want to find this person.

00:28:44.599 --> 00:28:45.880
And about Xiaoya you just mentioned,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.319
what exactly happened with that?

00:28:49.359 --> 00:28:51.599
How about we go see Dr. Xu?

00:28:51.599 --> 00:28:53.079
You don't understand anything at all.

00:28:54.799 --> 00:28:55.440
What's wrong?

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.200
You should go home first.

00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.599
I want to walk alone for a while.

00:29:06.039 --> 00:29:06.839
I can go with you.

00:29:07.119 --> 00:29:07.759
No need.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.359
I just need some time alone.

00:29:15.039 --> 00:29:15.599
Okay.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:45.880
Do you still remember Professor Zhong?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.160
Why bring him up?

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:50.720
Today,

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:53.400
I met him.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.119
How is he doing?

00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:58.559
Not well.

00:30:00.039 --> 00:30:01.200
Because of misconduct.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.319
How do you know?

00:30:05.799 --> 00:30:07.759
I've known for a long time that he's not a good person.

00:30:08.519 --> 00:30:10.559
I heard about it when I first started college.

00:30:10.559 --> 00:30:11.799
He pursued one of our senior classmates.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.720
It's said that he even harassed someone.

00:30:16.039 --> 00:30:17.400
It just wasn't exposed.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.200
Back then, I really couldn't tell.

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:25.319
Xu Xin, you're too kind.

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.000
The world is dangerous.

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:29.039
You must be cautious of everyone around you.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.880
I might really be sick.
