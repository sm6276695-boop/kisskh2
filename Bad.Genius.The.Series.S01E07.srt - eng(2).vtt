00:00:42.858 --> 00:00:44.331
When has the
world ever been fair?

00:00:44.356 --> 00:00:45.656
Choose your battles, Lin.

00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:47.643
The world is already
too complicated.

00:00:47.668 --> 00:00:49.545
Don’t make things
harder for yourself.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.846
I want you, Grace, to go with
Pat to study at Boston University.

00:00:54.871 --> 00:00:56.570
Why did you accept Boston?

00:00:56.595 --> 00:00:57.554
Are you that selfish?

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.485
You’ll do everything
just to get what you want?

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:00.762
If you want to
end this right now,

00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:02.455
then admit to your
dad that we're over.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.340
I have a client who
needs a stand-in for the

00:01:11.365 --> 00:01:14.421
Standard Test for
International Colleges Exam.

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:16.323
So tell me, what should I do?

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:17.357
Full name?

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:19.032
Grace Anne L. Dizon

00:01:19.865 --> 00:01:20.949
And date of birth?

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.530
February 21, 2007.

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:24.765
In what we’re going to do,

00:01:24.962 --> 00:01:28.298
the whole Philippines can benefit
from the answers to STIC.

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:30.027
I can’t do this alone.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.555
Someone has to help me.

00:01:31.726 --> 00:01:32.726
Mom,

00:01:34.038 --> 00:01:35.302
my decision is final.

00:01:36.519 --> 00:01:37.562
Please don’t stop me.

00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:39.756
Aren’t you earning money
from leaking the exam answers?

00:01:39.781 --> 00:01:40.679
Teach me.

00:01:41.932 --> 00:01:43.684
Thief! Help!

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:44.709
Help!

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:47.013
Hey!

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.522
Let’s go, hurry!

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:49.547
Let’s go, hurry!

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.379
Mom!

00:01:56.011 --> 00:01:57.005
- Ouch!
- Mom!

00:01:57.037 --> 00:01:58.747
- Mom!
- Ouch, Tristan!

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:00.586
My God, I think I’m dying.

00:02:00.951 --> 00:02:02.536
Help me, son!

00:02:02.536 --> 00:02:03.554
Mom!

00:02:04.141 --> 00:02:05.322
It hurts!

00:02:05.372 --> 00:02:07.332
It really hurts!

00:02:52.024 --> 00:02:55.027
Thoracic Laminectomy
is a major operation.

00:02:55.204 --> 00:02:57.832
That’s why there are a lot of
requirements for the patient.

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.669
Imaging studies.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:03.504
Bone density scan.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:05.422
Coagulation panels.

00:03:05.631 --> 00:03:06.715
And anesthesia.

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.008
Consultation.

00:03:10.094 --> 00:03:11.595
Since you don’t have insurance,

00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:13.430
all of this will cost—

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.765
Four hundred fifty thousand.

00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:20.604
I’m sorry, son.

00:03:20.813 --> 00:03:21.792
Stay strong, okay?

00:03:22.898 --> 00:03:23.732
I’ll go ahead.

00:03:23.732 --> 00:03:25.109
I still have other patients.

00:04:04.356 --> 00:04:05.356
Bank?

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:08.444
What are you doing here?

00:04:12.323 --> 00:04:14.783
Aren’t you earning money
from leaking the exam answers?

00:04:17.202 --> 00:04:18.412
Teach me.

00:04:25.794 --> 00:04:26.794
I need money.

00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:31.133
I need money to get
my mom operated on.

00:04:39.391 --> 00:04:40.976
Lin.

00:04:44.188 --> 00:04:45.188
Bank.

00:04:58.494 --> 00:04:59.494
Come in.

00:05:08.921 --> 00:05:09.921
What’s this place?

00:05:10.339 --> 00:05:12.675
This was my family’s
printing press but

00:05:12.925 --> 00:05:15.177
we moved, so now
it’s just a warehouse.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:17.471
So...

00:05:18.722 --> 00:05:20.240
What’s the plan?
Why are we here?

00:05:20.265 --> 00:05:21.266
So many questions!

00:05:21.475 --> 00:05:22.493
Pat.

00:05:22.518 --> 00:05:23.441
What?

00:05:23.477 --> 00:05:24.812
Lin, do you still
trust this guy?

00:05:25.145 --> 00:05:26.689
He's a fucking snitch.

00:05:26.814 --> 00:05:28.899
He’ll just cry and break,
he can’t handle this.

00:05:28.924 --> 00:05:29.931
Hon.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.310
What?

00:05:31.527 --> 00:05:33.505
Might as well
bring Tony back in.

00:05:33.696 --> 00:05:35.322
Isn’t there anyone
else to help us?

00:05:35.823 --> 00:05:36.823
What?

00:05:37.282 --> 00:05:38.533
You gonna fight me?

00:05:38.565 --> 00:05:39.593
Go for it, dude.

00:05:39.618 --> 00:05:40.619
Pat, that’s enough.

00:05:41.495 --> 00:05:42.913
If Bank isn’t part of our plan,

00:05:42.913 --> 00:05:45.624
then our plan won’t push
through. You know that.

00:05:53.138 --> 00:05:54.138
Pat.

00:05:55.968 --> 00:05:57.886
Let’s forget what happened
between us at school.

00:05:59.263 --> 00:06:00.681
That’s a different story now.

00:06:04.101 --> 00:06:05.425
You don’t have to be my friend.

00:06:05.867 --> 00:06:07.285
But you can trust me.

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:11.941
Lin,

00:06:12.234 --> 00:06:13.235
I’ll help you guys.

00:06:13.235 --> 00:06:15.112
You can count on
me, whatever it takes.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.957
We’re going to Australia,

00:06:28.375 --> 00:06:30.586
and we’ll take the STIC exam.

00:06:32.296 --> 00:06:34.840
So, how much are
we going to earn?

00:06:35.883 --> 00:06:37.009
One million.

00:06:39.528 --> 00:06:42.364
One million divided
by four so 250k each?

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:43.389
Right?

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:45.099
No, Bank.

00:06:45.351 --> 00:06:46.351
Oh.

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:47.394
Sorry, sorry.

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.105
Is there anyone else in our group?

00:06:49.772 --> 00:06:52.483
You know, honestly, any
amount is fine with me.

00:06:52.483 --> 00:06:54.208
50k, that’s already
a big help for me.

00:06:54.233 --> 00:06:55.401
That’s just for you.

00:06:56.028 --> 00:06:57.488
We each get one million.

00:07:09.958 --> 00:07:10.958
Game.

00:07:12.878 --> 00:07:13.878
Okay.

00:07:15.255 --> 00:07:17.723
The time difference between
Sydney and Manila is three hours.

00:07:18.342 --> 00:07:20.344
One, two, three.

00:07:23.305 --> 00:07:25.307
After uploading the photo
and filling out the form

00:07:25.307 --> 00:07:26.517
for the application,

00:07:26.975 --> 00:07:28.556
we’ll take the exam there.

00:07:28.894 --> 00:07:30.952
Then we’ll send
the answers here.

00:07:31.396 --> 00:07:32.815
So we’re going to Sydney?

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:34.817
We need to go there.

00:07:35.567 --> 00:07:37.890
One, two, three.

00:07:49.873 --> 00:07:52.251
Only limited items are
allowed in the exam room.

00:07:52.584 --> 00:07:56.004
Pencil, eraser, passport,
and registration form.

00:07:57.422 --> 00:07:59.883
So how do we give the answers?

00:08:00.968 --> 00:08:02.027
Memory.

00:08:02.052 --> 00:08:03.679
The STIC has four sections.

00:08:04.012 --> 00:08:06.098
You mean we have
to memorize all of that?

00:08:07.307 --> 00:08:10.102
Three, two, one, go.

00:08:11.854 --> 00:08:12.854
Split it up.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.483
So Bank, you memorize
the second half.

00:08:19.528 --> 00:08:22.447
And then Lin
gets the first half.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.950
Section one,

00:08:26.243 --> 00:08:28.954
answer half of the
questions in just 30 minutes.

00:08:40.424 --> 00:08:41.675
And time!

00:08:41.884 --> 00:08:43.510
But how do we send
out the answers?

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.554
We’ll bring spare phones.

00:08:46.305 --> 00:08:49.391
We’ll hide the spare phones
in the CR inside the toilet tank.

00:08:52.186 --> 00:08:54.396
There’s a 10-minute
break every exam section.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.440
In between those breaks,

00:08:56.732 --> 00:08:58.859
we’ll send the answers
using the phone.

00:09:02.196 --> 00:09:03.196
A.

00:09:04.344 --> 00:09:05.344
A.

00:09:05.407 --> 00:09:06.074
C.

00:09:06.074 --> 00:09:06.925
B.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.950
C.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.783
For the examinees
or just for us?

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.806
Nope.

00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:13.874
Uh, just through me.

00:09:13.874 --> 00:09:17.044
I am in charge of getting
all the answers to the clients.

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:21.338
B.

00:09:38.565 --> 00:09:39.691
Look at the barcode.

00:09:40.317 --> 00:09:42.527
So every bar
represents an answer.

00:09:42.945 --> 00:09:46.114
From A being the thickest
to D being the thinnest.

00:09:47.407 --> 00:09:50.160
All clients will get three
pencils and each pencil

00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.788
represents every
section of the STIC exam.

00:09:54.331 --> 00:09:55.331
Okay.

00:09:55.951 --> 00:09:57.434
Then what about
the essay portion?

00:09:57.459 --> 00:10:00.128
The only thing we can do
is to provide the essay topic.

00:10:00.712 --> 00:10:02.256
They’ll handle the research.

00:10:03.623 --> 00:10:05.198
And the clients
are fine with that?

00:10:06.343 --> 00:10:07.636
Small thing, Banky.

00:10:08.929 --> 00:10:10.639
They won’t complain.

00:10:11.181 --> 00:10:12.474
I’ll take care of them.

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:17.980
Nice to meet you.

00:10:18.314 --> 00:10:19.523
I’m Pat Tioseco.

00:10:21.108 --> 00:10:24.611
We have contract signing here
and all meetings are recorded.

00:10:25.153 --> 00:10:27.781
No one will snitch because
you’re already accomplices.

00:10:29.205 --> 00:10:30.205
Cheating?

00:10:30.784 --> 00:10:31.784
Nah.

00:10:32.077 --> 00:10:33.161
I like the word,

00:10:33.745 --> 00:10:34.745
investment.

00:10:35.414 --> 00:10:37.361
Investment for your future.

00:10:37.916 --> 00:10:40.544
One test result is all it
takes to change your life.

00:10:41.086 --> 00:10:42.086
I’m risking.

00:10:42.713 --> 00:10:43.714
As they say,

00:10:44.339 --> 00:10:46.008
education is a right.

00:10:47.384 --> 00:10:48.760
So let’s work smart

00:10:49.344 --> 00:10:50.554
and let’s work together.

00:10:51.638 --> 00:10:52.806
But hey,

00:10:54.224 --> 00:10:55.517
this stays between us, okay?

00:10:58.937 --> 00:10:59.855
Cash only, bro.

00:10:59.855 --> 00:11:01.440
Of course we don’t
want a paper trail.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.153
Alright, just make sure to send the
full payment within the week, okay?

00:11:06.153 --> 00:11:07.492
No refunds.

00:11:08.071 --> 00:11:09.071
Aight.

00:11:12.659 --> 00:11:14.536
Business is booming, guys.

00:11:14.536 --> 00:11:15.554
Let’s go.

00:11:15.579 --> 00:11:17.122
We’re close to the finish line.

00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.291
Good job, team.

00:11:23.211 --> 00:11:25.363
Well, me and Grace
are about to head out.

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.107
Are you ready, hon?

00:11:27.132 --> 00:11:27.899
Yeah.

00:11:27.924 --> 00:11:29.384
Are you guys
gonna hitch or what?

00:11:30.594 --> 00:11:31.761
Uhm.

00:11:32.429 --> 00:11:34.973
I just have one request.

00:11:36.154 --> 00:11:37.154
What is it, Bank?

00:11:38.644 --> 00:11:41.063
Maybe I can get my

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:43.523
first 500,000.

00:11:43.774 --> 00:11:44.774
What?

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:46.695
Are you serious?

00:11:48.612 --> 00:11:49.446
I’m sorry.

00:11:49.446 --> 00:11:51.073
It’s just that I really need

00:11:51.782 --> 00:11:54.368
money for my mom’s
surgery and private room.

00:11:55.994 --> 00:11:57.472
Well, we had an agreement.

00:11:57.913 --> 00:12:00.791
I won’t pay you until
the STIC is finished.

00:12:02.042 --> 00:12:03.293
But what if you ghost us?

00:12:03.877 --> 00:12:05.253
I wouldn’t do that to you guys.

00:12:09.007 --> 00:12:10.967
Eh, even Lin hasn’t
received her share yet.

00:12:11.635 --> 00:12:12.694
- How much more to you?
- Pat.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:14.262
That’s so unfair for her.

00:12:14.638 --> 00:12:15.638
Pat,

00:12:16.181 --> 00:12:17.891
it’s okay with me to wait.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:20.197
But Bank,

00:12:20.945 --> 00:12:22.771
he needs money for his mom.

00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:24.235
Okay?

00:12:27.401 --> 00:12:28.693
Can we trust you?

00:12:35.992 --> 00:12:36.992
Fine.

00:12:39.663 --> 00:12:41.248
But if you run away,

00:12:41.957 --> 00:12:43.125
you're fucking dead.

00:12:48.839 --> 00:12:49.856
And Lin,

00:12:49.881 --> 00:12:52.050
that’s your responsibility
if he doesn’t come back.

00:12:53.218 --> 00:12:56.388
You need to memorize
and send all the answers.

00:12:57.090 --> 00:12:58.191
Can you do that?

00:12:58.223 --> 00:12:59.724
I trust Bank.

00:13:16.032 --> 00:13:17.032
Oh,

00:13:17.742 --> 00:13:18.660
why are you home just now?

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:19.701
Have you eaten?

00:13:20.871 --> 00:13:21.871
Dad?

00:13:22.914 --> 00:13:24.332
Something happened to you again.

00:13:26.543 --> 00:13:28.253
I spoke to Mom.

00:13:31.548 --> 00:13:34.634
She said she wants to see me.

00:13:35.712 --> 00:13:37.338
I’m going to Sydney.

00:13:38.638 --> 00:13:40.140
She already bought a ticket.

00:13:40.724 --> 00:13:41.766
She bought you a ticket?

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:42.865
Since when?

00:13:43.351 --> 00:13:44.853
I contacted her last week.

00:13:45.645 --> 00:13:47.397
I’m leaving in three days.

00:13:52.402 --> 00:13:53.320
Three days?

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.114
Good thing you even thought
of telling your dad, huh?

00:13:56.687 --> 00:13:57.632
I’m sorry, dad.

00:13:57.657 --> 00:13:58.800
I’ve been meaning to tell you.

00:13:58.825 --> 00:13:59.825
It’s just,

00:13:59.993 --> 00:14:01.195
I couldn’t find the right timing.

00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.304
But you contacted her.

00:14:03.371 --> 00:14:05.415
You decided without telling me.

00:14:05.999 --> 00:14:07.136
Come on, son.

00:14:07.167 --> 00:14:10.446
There’s no problem if I talk
to Mom whenever I want.

00:14:10.471 --> 00:14:12.348
No problem, talk to your mom.

00:14:14.090 --> 00:14:16.301
But if you’re leaving the
country alone, do you think

00:14:16.301 --> 00:14:18.345
I wouldn’t worry something
might happen to you?

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:23.642
I can take care of myself,
Dad, and I’ll be with Mom.

00:14:23.892 --> 00:14:25.727
I trust you, but not your mom.

00:14:26.144 --> 00:14:27.370
But Dad...

00:14:27.395 --> 00:14:28.563
I’ll come back.

00:14:30.232 --> 00:14:32.984
I won’t be like mom who left you here.

00:14:37.781 --> 00:14:38.781
Dad.

00:14:40.617 --> 00:14:42.369
I just miss Mom.

00:14:43.703 --> 00:14:46.790
I hope you won’t be angry
if I want to see her too.

00:14:50.335 --> 00:14:51.127
Why would I be angry?

00:14:51.127 --> 00:14:52.193
She’s your mom.

00:14:54.381 --> 00:14:55.840
It’s your right to see her.

00:14:57.175 --> 00:14:58.301
But next time,

00:14:58.627 --> 00:14:59.928
before making a decision,

00:15:01.179 --> 00:15:02.180
tell me first.

00:15:31.042 --> 00:15:32.048
Bank,

00:15:32.127 --> 00:15:33.670
have you been there a while?

00:15:35.621 --> 00:15:36.621
Yes, Ma.

00:15:37.007 --> 00:15:39.009
But you were
sleeping so soundly.

00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:41.574
So, it’s really nice here, huh?

00:15:42.012 --> 00:15:43.805
So this is what private is like.

00:15:44.806 --> 00:15:46.016
It’s so quiet.

00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.310
And so cold.

00:15:48.685 --> 00:15:50.958
Can you turn off the aircon first?

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:55.625
There, Ma.

00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:56.650
All good now.

00:16:05.535 --> 00:16:07.078
Where did you get the money?

00:16:10.415 --> 00:16:11.875
Don’t worry about that, Ma.

00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:17.881
I don’t want to
stay here anymore.

00:16:17.881 --> 00:16:19.003
I want to go home.

00:16:19.884 --> 00:16:20.884
Ma!

00:16:21.343 --> 00:16:22.343
Oh dear,

00:16:22.469 --> 00:16:23.637
I don’t want to spend more.

00:16:23.637 --> 00:16:25.106
Life is so hard now.

00:16:25.347 --> 00:16:26.348
My child.

00:16:27.724 --> 00:16:28.724
Ma.

00:16:29.351 --> 00:16:30.977
Please don’t think about the money.

00:16:32.771 --> 00:16:34.064
I’ll take care of you.

00:16:35.690 --> 00:16:38.526
Do you remember my friend Pat?

00:16:39.235 --> 00:16:40.239
He’s rich.

00:16:40.695 --> 00:16:41.821
He lends me money.

00:16:49.871 --> 00:16:51.331
So you two are close, huh?

00:16:53.714 --> 00:16:54.714
And also,

00:16:55.335 --> 00:16:57.879
I have a part-time job.

00:16:58.463 --> 00:17:00.715
I tutor kids every MWF.

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:12.060
I’m really so lucky to have you.

00:17:14.437 --> 00:17:17.357
Maybe if your
dad didn’t leave us,

00:17:18.191 --> 00:17:21.027
Life wouldn’t be this
hard now, my child.

00:17:23.321 --> 00:17:24.381
Come on, Ma.

00:17:24.406 --> 00:17:25.907
We’ve come a long way.

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.660
And Dad never really
abandoned us either.

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:37.085
Just remember, son, if,

00:17:41.089 --> 00:17:45.135
if your problems become
too heavy, ask for help, okay?

00:18:03.027 --> 00:18:04.027
Oh,

00:18:06.114 --> 00:18:07.615
we need to wrap up.

00:18:08.158 --> 00:18:09.743
I have to go home early.

00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:12.536
Curfew?

00:18:14.873 --> 00:18:17.042
I need to get on dad's good side.

00:18:19.085 --> 00:18:22.422
He was upset when I told
him I was leaving for Australia.

00:18:24.758 --> 00:18:25.758
How about you?

00:18:28.261 --> 00:18:30.138
I can’t tell mom
that I’m leaving.

00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:31.931
It’ll just make her worry.

00:18:33.433 --> 00:18:34.893
Anyway, it’s only a few days.

00:18:37.562 --> 00:18:38.566
Just think,

00:18:39.939 --> 00:18:42.317
in just a few days
our lives will change.

00:18:43.359 --> 00:18:45.784
Then you’ll finally fulfill your
dream of studying abroad.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.698
You’ll be able to go
to med school too.

00:18:50.950 --> 00:18:53.912
More importantly, we won’t need to
compete for the scholarship anymore.

00:18:55.663 --> 00:18:56.873
So now,

00:18:57.957 --> 00:19:00.752
maybe we can
finally be real friends?

00:19:05.792 --> 00:19:06.792
Lin?

00:19:07.409 --> 00:19:08.409
Bank?

00:19:08.551 --> 00:19:09.551
Wow,

00:19:10.011 --> 00:19:11.356
you two look so happy there!

00:19:11.846 --> 00:19:13.056
Right, hon?

00:19:13.056 --> 00:19:14.974
I wonder what we missed.

00:19:16.101 --> 00:19:16.743
Oh.

00:19:16.768 --> 00:19:18.645
Here are your application forms.

00:19:19.145 --> 00:19:21.471
And here are your boarding passes.

00:19:21.496 --> 00:19:24.250
Direct flight Manila to
Sydney, that’s 8 hours.

00:19:24.275 --> 00:19:27.362
So you leave at night, then when
you wake up, it’ll be morning in Sydney.

00:19:29.447 --> 00:19:30.782
Wait, hon.

00:19:31.597 --> 00:19:32.597
Um...

00:19:33.451 --> 00:19:35.120
We forgot about their rooms.

00:19:37.288 --> 00:19:38.414
Oh, right.

00:19:38.414 --> 00:19:40.250
What’s our favorite
hotel again, hon?

00:19:40.747 --> 00:19:42.665
But I think it’s fully booked.

00:19:44.003 --> 00:19:44.546
No, hon.

00:19:44.546 --> 00:19:46.339
But the resort is too far.

00:19:46.339 --> 00:19:49.425
They should stay at a
place near the site instead.

00:19:50.009 --> 00:19:51.553
Okay, just book the hotel, hon.

00:19:51.553 --> 00:19:52.445
But,

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:54.097
let’s keep it budget-friendly.

00:19:55.098 --> 00:19:57.016
You two can share a room,

00:19:57.934 --> 00:19:59.102
so you’ll be closer.

00:19:59.644 --> 00:20:00.658
Hon?

00:20:01.229 --> 00:20:02.229
What?

00:20:02.730 --> 00:20:03.940
It’s twin beds.

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.942
And you won’t even be side by side.

00:20:06.352 --> 00:20:07.352
Wait,

00:20:08.444 --> 00:20:10.530
we shouldn’t be in the same hotel.

00:20:10.989 --> 00:20:12.282
That would look suspicious.

00:20:13.663 --> 00:20:16.241
Even in flights, why
are we seated together?

00:20:17.579 --> 00:20:18.555
Right, right.

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.873
Ah yeah, it’s true.

00:20:20.874 --> 00:20:22.333
You’re right, as always.

00:20:24.419 --> 00:20:25.879
We’ll figure something out.

00:20:27.781 --> 00:20:28.781
Who’s that, Grace?

00:20:31.134 --> 00:20:32.134
I don’t know.

00:20:33.428 --> 00:20:35.013
There shouldn’t be anyone here.

00:20:35.013 --> 00:20:36.021
Yo, chill.

00:20:36.723 --> 00:20:37.807
I just sent someone.

00:20:38.775 --> 00:20:39.852
Bank, I hope

00:20:40.059 --> 00:20:41.644
your mom doesn’t have allergies.

00:20:41.978 --> 00:20:42.979
I got her flowers.

00:20:43.438 --> 00:20:44.463
I’ll be back.

00:20:44.814 --> 00:20:45.899
Pat, do you need help?

00:20:57.744 --> 00:20:58.744
You took so long.

00:20:59.245 --> 00:20:59.996
Sorry, boss.

00:20:59.996 --> 00:21:01.289
We almost got into trouble.

00:21:08.235 --> 00:21:09.272
Thief!

00:21:09.297 --> 00:21:10.297
Help!

00:21:11.507 --> 00:21:12.507
Hey!

00:21:16.672 --> 00:21:17.672
Alright.

00:21:17.931 --> 00:21:19.574
I’ll just send the
payment to the number.

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:20.909
Thank you, boss Pat.

00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:22.894
By the way, what about the
money from the laundry shop

00:21:22.894 --> 00:21:24.145
that you told us to steal?

00:21:25.146 --> 00:21:25.997
That’s yours now.

00:21:26.022 --> 00:21:27.523
Go on, leave.

00:21:59.238 --> 00:22:00.853
Bank, are you okay?

00:22:00.878 --> 00:22:01.968
Bank,

00:22:02.141 --> 00:22:03.601
here’s the bouquet for your mom.

00:22:06.037 --> 00:22:07.038
- Bank!
- Guys!

00:22:09.774 --> 00:22:11.025
Guys, stop it!

00:22:11.567 --> 00:22:13.236
Why did you do this to us, Pat?

00:22:13.236 --> 00:22:14.529
Why did you do this to us?

00:22:14.904 --> 00:22:16.197
What are you talking about!

00:22:16.239 --> 00:22:18.574
Stop lying to us, boss Pat!

00:22:19.659 --> 00:22:20.576
I caught you.

00:22:20.576 --> 00:22:21.953
I heard everything outside.

00:22:22.245 --> 00:22:24.180
The guys who
gave you the flowers.

00:22:24.205 --> 00:22:26.846
They’re the same guys
you ordered to rob our shop.

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:28.126
I saw the plate number.

00:22:28.126 --> 00:22:29.394
I saw the helmet.

00:22:29.419 --> 00:22:31.629
And I heard that the
money we worked hard for…

00:22:31.629 --> 00:22:32.733
You just gave it away!

00:22:34.966 --> 00:22:35.842
No, come on guys!

00:22:35.842 --> 00:22:37.318
You’ll believe him?

00:22:37.343 --> 00:22:38.602
He’s just stressed out!

00:22:38.636 --> 00:22:39.512
Bank, stop it!

00:22:39.512 --> 00:22:40.613
He’s just imagining things!

00:22:40.638 --> 00:22:41.723
Fuck you, Pat!

00:22:42.181 --> 00:22:44.475
Because of you, my
mom’s in the hospital!

00:22:46.352 --> 00:22:48.229
Bank, why are you doing this?

00:22:49.272 --> 00:22:51.149
Pat, tell the truth, please!

00:22:52.650 --> 00:22:53.650
Come on!

00:22:57.057 --> 00:22:58.057
Okay, fine.

00:22:59.490 --> 00:23:00.783
Okay, Bank. Listen to me.

00:23:01.993 --> 00:23:03.036
I didn’t mean it.

00:23:03.036 --> 00:23:04.871
Yes, I paid them to
mess up your shop.

00:23:04.871 --> 00:23:07.015
But I didn’t tell them
to hurt your mom.

00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:08.499
I just want you to help us!

00:23:08.499 --> 00:23:09.667
Well, it already
happened, right?

00:23:09.692 --> 00:23:10.697
But she’s fine!

00:23:11.544 --> 00:23:13.171
You already got your 500k!

00:23:13.963 --> 00:23:15.690
If you want, I’ll give
you half of my share.

00:23:15.715 --> 00:23:16.733
Stupid!

00:23:16.758 --> 00:23:18.818
Not everything can be
solved with money, okay?

00:23:18.843 --> 00:23:20.153
Bank, we’re desperate!

00:23:20.178 --> 00:23:22.696
If all this didn’t happen,
you wouldn’t have said yes.

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:25.244
You, Lin.

00:23:25.475 --> 00:23:26.771
You’re involved
in this too, right?

00:23:26.796 --> 00:23:27.839
Bank, I don’t know
anything about that,

00:23:27.864 --> 00:23:30.163
and if I knew that
was Pat’s plan,

00:23:30.188 --> 00:23:32.065
I would never have
allowed him to do it.

00:23:35.276 --> 00:23:36.351
It’s just me, Bank.

00:23:36.944 --> 00:23:38.446
Grace has nothing to do with this.

00:23:39.505 --> 00:23:40.464
Just remember this, Pat.

00:23:40.489 --> 00:23:41.612
I’m telling you,

00:23:41.949 --> 00:23:43.409
I’ll return all of this to you.

00:23:47.615 --> 00:23:48.615
Fine.

00:23:48.831 --> 00:23:49.832
I deserve it.

00:23:52.043 --> 00:23:53.120
But,

00:23:53.294 --> 00:23:54.295
it’s so cool though, right?

00:23:54.295 --> 00:23:55.146
The…

00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:57.090
plan we had with STIC?

00:23:58.132 --> 00:23:59.509
Damn it, are you serious, Pat?

00:24:00.927 --> 00:24:03.346
Bank, this is not
about you and me.

00:24:03.346 --> 00:24:05.196
We need to finish the plan.

00:24:05.431 --> 00:24:07.825
There are so many clients
waiting, Bank, please.

00:24:07.850 --> 00:24:09.143
That’s no longer my problem.

00:24:09.602 --> 00:24:11.479
Go find someone else
to help you instead,

00:24:11.479 --> 00:24:12.852
because I'm done here.

00:24:13.439 --> 00:24:14.439
Bank!

00:24:14.941 --> 00:24:16.029
Stop it, Lin!

00:24:16.567 --> 00:24:18.111
You're all liars!

00:24:19.237 --> 00:24:21.697
Bank, can we
please talk properly?

00:24:23.149 --> 00:24:24.859
Hon, I'm sorry this happened.

00:24:28.079 --> 00:24:29.158
How...

00:24:30.706 --> 00:24:32.542
how could you do that?

00:24:32.959 --> 00:24:34.544
Hon, I did that for us!

00:24:34.836 --> 00:24:37.046
Isn't that what you wanted
for us to be together?

00:24:37.046 --> 00:24:38.065
Yes!

00:24:39.549 --> 00:24:41.634
Yes, but not like this!

00:24:45.054 --> 00:24:46.848
Not like this, Pat.

00:24:54.508 --> 00:24:55.508
Grace...

00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:19.130
At last, you're awake, Mom.

00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.383
I thought maybe later
you won’t be able to sleep.

00:25:22.925 --> 00:25:25.094
The medicine makes me sleepy.

00:25:30.959 --> 00:25:31.959
Oh, Mom,

00:25:32.059 --> 00:25:33.059
here.

00:25:35.871 --> 00:25:37.140
You still need to
take this medicine,

00:25:37.172 --> 00:25:38.173
please get up first.

00:25:57.251 --> 00:25:58.836
Thank you, Doc.

00:26:00.338 --> 00:26:02.298
It feels so good to hear, right?

00:26:04.550 --> 00:26:05.628
Doctor...

00:26:06.135 --> 00:26:07.135
Bangkat.

00:26:08.846 --> 00:26:09.889
Someday.

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.640
Wait.

00:26:12.141 --> 00:26:14.101
I'm not pressuring you, okay.

00:26:15.019 --> 00:26:17.396
If ever you change your mind

00:26:17.396 --> 00:26:21.108
and you don’t want Medicine
anymore, that’s okay with me.

00:26:23.986 --> 00:26:25.321
I'm still your doctor, Ma.

00:26:26.447 --> 00:26:27.782
For you and Papa.

00:26:28.783 --> 00:26:30.159
I promised that already.

00:26:30.621 --> 00:26:31.706
Even before, right?

00:26:35.122 --> 00:26:37.500
So how are your clients?

00:26:38.584 --> 00:26:39.752
Huh? Clients?

00:26:40.962 --> 00:26:42.088
Didn’t you say

00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.257
you’re tutoring?

00:26:44.382 --> 00:26:45.591
Tell me about it.

00:26:45.758 --> 00:26:47.647
Do the kids listen to you?

00:26:49.428 --> 00:26:50.428
Ah.

00:26:52.098 --> 00:26:53.514
Yes, of course.

00:26:53.539 --> 00:26:54.607
And also,

00:26:55.518 --> 00:26:59.814
it’s lucky too because when
there’s overtime, there’s a bonus,

00:26:59.814 --> 00:27:01.482
and there are also
many incentives.

00:27:07.363 --> 00:27:09.198
Tristan,

00:27:14.078 --> 00:27:15.454
I know

00:27:16.372 --> 00:27:19.875
that there’s a lot you don’t tell me.

00:27:24.422 --> 00:27:25.667
You’re grown up now.

00:27:26.632 --> 00:27:27.925
You’re smart.

00:27:30.428 --> 00:27:33.306
You know what’s right and wrong.

00:27:35.474 --> 00:27:40.646
As long as if it gets hard and you need

00:27:41.772 --> 00:27:43.399
help with problems

00:27:43.399 --> 00:27:47.695
or even just someone to talk
to, I’m right here, son, okay?

00:27:51.324 --> 00:27:52.658
I’m fine, Ma.

00:28:07.882 --> 00:28:08.934
Come in.

00:28:18.684 --> 00:28:19.684
Oh.

00:28:20.853 --> 00:28:22.197
Good evening, tita.

00:28:22.222 --> 00:28:24.766
Uh, I brought
some fruits for you.

00:28:24.791 --> 00:28:26.251
Oh, thank you.

00:28:26.889 --> 00:28:28.805
You visited and even
brought something.

00:28:29.195 --> 00:28:30.838
How are you feeling now?

00:28:30.863 --> 00:28:31.863
I’m okay.

00:28:32.323 --> 00:28:33.741
Just fighting off

00:28:34.492 --> 00:28:35.701
the body pain.

00:28:36.035 --> 00:28:37.745
But I can handle this.

00:28:37.828 --> 00:28:38.871
I’ll endure it.

00:28:39.372 --> 00:28:40.456
I’m used to this.

00:28:40.456 --> 00:28:42.416
That’s just how life is, right?

00:28:42.958 --> 00:28:44.168
Good thing Bank is here.

00:28:49.353 --> 00:28:50.056
Alright.

00:28:50.091 --> 00:28:51.317
Chat with Ma for now.

00:28:51.342 --> 00:28:52.985
I’ll just go to the
pharmacy before it closes.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:55.221
Oh no, take Lin with you.

00:28:56.764 --> 00:28:57.740
It’s okay.

00:28:57.765 --> 00:28:58.617
I’ll go with you.

00:28:58.642 --> 00:28:59.492
No, no.

00:28:59.517 --> 00:29:00.525
It’s fine.

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:02.074
Go with him.

00:29:02.228 --> 00:29:04.864
Later the nurses will be
making their rounds anyway.

00:29:05.314 --> 00:29:06.607
I’ll have company.

00:29:07.191 --> 00:29:08.218
Go ahead, you two.

00:29:10.319 --> 00:29:11.319
Get well soon.

00:29:43.394 --> 00:29:46.772
I just want to apologize
for what happened earlier.

00:29:49.066 --> 00:29:50.264
You did nothing wrong, Lin.

00:29:51.652 --> 00:29:53.295
I should be the one to apologize

00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.864
because I left you hanging.

00:29:56.282 --> 00:29:57.741
What Pat did was really wrong.

00:29:58.367 --> 00:30:00.953
And there’s no excuse
that can justify it.

00:30:04.832 --> 00:30:05.832
Bank,

00:30:06.834 --> 00:30:08.461
just focus on your mom.

00:30:09.295 --> 00:30:11.088
I’ll handle STIC.

00:30:12.089 --> 00:30:13.577
You’ll still get your share.

00:30:15.468 --> 00:30:16.510
Thanks, Lin.

00:30:17.178 --> 00:30:20.639
But you and I both know you can’t
memorize the entire STIC exam.

00:30:22.725 --> 00:30:24.702
I already got my 500,000.

00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:25.780
I still have some left.

00:30:26.061 --> 00:30:28.452
I can return that to you so you
can find someone to replace me.

00:30:28.624 --> 00:30:29.624
No need.

00:30:30.858 --> 00:30:32.109
We already split the money,

00:30:32.109 --> 00:30:33.151
fair and square.

00:30:34.153 --> 00:30:35.946
I don’t need assistance, Lin.

00:30:36.238 --> 00:30:37.173
Wait.

00:30:37.198 --> 00:30:38.657
I’m not belittling you.

00:30:38.991 --> 00:30:40.387
But it’s still the same, right?

00:30:41.243 --> 00:30:43.537
Even if you don’t admit
it, you see me differently

00:30:43.537 --> 00:30:45.327
because our lives are different.

00:30:46.582 --> 00:30:49.376
You pity us because no
matter how fair we try to fight,

00:30:49.376 --> 00:30:50.586
we never win.

00:30:50.586 --> 00:30:51.687
Right?

00:30:51.798 --> 00:30:53.842
Don’t separate yourself from me.

00:30:55.216 --> 00:30:56.842
We’re both just finding ways

00:30:56.842 --> 00:30:58.672
to change our situations, right?

00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:04.642
Life is just really hard in the
Philippines if you’re not born rich.

00:31:06.310 --> 00:31:08.187
But are we just
going to give up?

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:11.180
Of course, we’ll just
do our best, right?

00:31:11.953 --> 00:31:13.854
That’s the only fight we have.

00:31:19.417 --> 00:31:20.912
But for people like Pat,

00:31:22.117 --> 00:31:23.677
they don’t fight fair

00:31:23.702 --> 00:31:25.538
even if they already have
the advantage of wealth.

00:31:29.083 --> 00:31:30.083
If you,

00:31:30.543 --> 00:31:31.543
stand up to him,

00:31:32.836 --> 00:31:34.004
we’ll understand you.

00:31:41.428 --> 00:31:42.428
No, Lin.

00:31:43.326 --> 00:31:44.355
I’ve changed my mind.

00:31:45.808 --> 00:31:48.269
We’ll go to Sydney
and take the STIC.

00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:50.688
I won’t leave you in the fight.

00:31:52.106 --> 00:31:53.106
You’re right.

00:31:54.233 --> 00:31:55.484
We’re not competitors,

00:31:56.443 --> 00:31:57.528
we’re friends,

00:31:58.571 --> 00:31:59.780
and friends

00:32:01.073 --> 00:32:02.073
don’t abandon each other.

00:32:08.824 --> 00:32:09.824
Thank you.

00:32:22.177 --> 00:32:24.054
Lin, let me take you home.

00:32:24.054 --> 00:32:25.531
I’ll just change
then I’ll book a ride.

00:32:25.556 --> 00:32:26.348
It’s fine, Dad.

00:32:26.348 --> 00:32:27.808
You might be late for class.

00:32:28.142 --> 00:32:29.142
Are you sure?

00:32:30.436 --> 00:32:31.645
This is the first time
this is happening.

00:32:31.645 --> 00:32:33.647
This is the first time my
baby Linlin will be far from me.

00:32:34.023 --> 00:32:35.239
Dad, come on!

00:32:35.264 --> 00:32:36.960
I’ll only be gone
for a few days.

00:32:39.403 --> 00:32:40.738
I’m sorry.

00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.365
I thought that

00:32:44.271 --> 00:32:46.898
as long as I did
everything I could,

00:32:46.923 --> 00:32:47.944
even alone...

00:32:48.704 --> 00:32:49.770
that was enough.

00:32:50.497 --> 00:32:53.000
Sorry if I fell short.

00:32:53.113 --> 00:32:55.194
No, you’re not lacking, Dad.

00:32:55.419 --> 00:32:57.212
You’ve given more
than enough and

00:32:57.671 --> 00:32:59.089
I’m lucky to have you.

00:33:00.591 --> 00:33:01.591
Thank you.

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:04.595
But I also understand that
you need to see your mom.

00:33:04.903 --> 00:33:06.322
It’s good that you two can talk

00:33:06.347 --> 00:33:07.642
at least even for a while.

00:33:08.807 --> 00:33:10.059
That’s it, I get it.

00:33:10.059 --> 00:33:12.478
I want you to know
that I love you.

00:33:12.478 --> 00:33:13.896
So whatever it is you need,

00:33:14.744 --> 00:33:16.689
I’ll accept it.
It just hurts my pride.

00:33:17.316 --> 00:33:18.692
But I do get it.

00:33:18.942 --> 00:33:19.942
And also,

00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:21.417
I hope...

00:33:21.820 --> 00:33:23.113
I hope nothing changes.

00:33:24.031 --> 00:33:25.574
This is just for a
short while, Dad.

00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:28.203
It'll be back to
normal when I return.

00:33:28.429 --> 00:33:29.370
That's what's important.

00:33:29.370 --> 00:33:30.162
That you'll come back.

00:33:31.163 --> 00:33:32.640
- Promise.
- Promise.

00:33:32.665 --> 00:33:33.986
- Promise.
- Oh, here.

00:33:35.292 --> 00:33:36.018
What is this?

00:33:36.043 --> 00:33:36.894
Oh, don’t open it.

00:33:36.919 --> 00:33:37.919
It’s nothing.

00:33:38.087 --> 00:33:38.796
Music box.

00:33:38.796 --> 00:33:41.590
It plays your favorite piece.

00:33:41.965 --> 00:33:43.300
So you can remember me.

00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:46.387
I know no matter how beautiful
your mom’s house is in Australia.

00:33:46.387 --> 00:33:47.446
It doesn’t have a piano.

00:33:48.347 --> 00:33:49.556
Thank you, Dad.

00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:51.308
Thank you so much!

00:33:51.517 --> 00:33:52.534
You're welcome.

00:33:52.559 --> 00:33:53.632
Wow!

00:33:53.727 --> 00:33:54.745
I'll take this.

00:33:54.770 --> 00:33:55.820
I'll take you there.

00:33:56.188 --> 00:33:56.855
Really?

00:33:58.065 --> 00:33:59.110
Thank you, Dad.

00:34:04.279 --> 00:34:05.485
What is this?

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:06.510
It’s too heavy.

00:34:16.834 --> 00:34:18.001
Oh, are you ready?

00:34:18.368 --> 00:34:19.169
Let’s go.

00:34:19.169 --> 00:34:20.154
Okay, wait a minute.

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:23.465
Grace, Pat.

00:34:23.902 --> 00:34:24.902
This is it.

00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:26.427
We’re already in Australia.

00:34:26.705 --> 00:34:27.937
Thanks, sis.

00:34:28.303 --> 00:34:29.071
Okay.

00:34:29.096 --> 00:34:29.982
Good luck, guys.

00:34:31.014 --> 00:34:31.807
Later, sis.

00:34:31.807 --> 00:34:32.908
Roaming is expensive.

00:34:32.933 --> 00:34:33.988
Take care there.

00:34:34.143 --> 00:34:34.702
Okay.

00:34:34.727 --> 00:34:35.821
Bye, sis.

00:34:35.853 --> 00:34:36.853
You guys take care.

00:34:37.312 --> 00:34:38.312
Okay.

00:34:40.774 --> 00:34:41.774
There.

00:34:42.693 --> 00:34:43.693
This is it.

00:34:45.362 --> 00:34:47.297
Wow. We've come a long way, huh?

00:34:47.322 --> 00:34:47.823
I'm Lin.

00:34:47.823 --> 00:34:49.219
Also Grade 11, Section A.

00:34:49.383 --> 00:34:50.801
- Lin Estrella?
- Yeah.

00:34:50.826 --> 00:34:52.170
- Why?
- I'm Bank!

00:34:53.162 --> 00:34:55.222
I’m the one you stole
the scholarship from.

00:34:55.247 --> 00:35:00.878
Possenti has been chosen
to host the Teen Genius Quiz.

00:35:02.337 --> 00:35:04.715
And I want the
two of you to join.

00:35:05.883 --> 00:35:07.634
What is the value of Pi,

00:35:08.264 --> 00:35:10.600
to twelve decimal places?

00:35:12.417 --> 00:35:13.417
Relax.

00:35:14.016 --> 00:35:15.159
We can win this.

00:35:15.184 --> 00:35:16.272
For what?

00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:17.728
So you can be the first to answer?

00:35:18.687 --> 00:35:19.687
No, thanks.

00:35:21.857 --> 00:35:24.193
Tristan wasn’t able to
take the exam earlier,

00:35:24.193 --> 00:35:27.410
so he’ll be taking
it with your section.

00:35:27.821 --> 00:35:28.876
What the heck?

00:35:28.906 --> 00:35:30.657
I can’t concentrate
with what you’re doing.

00:35:33.827 --> 00:35:35.204
Can we talk?

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:44.851
Oh, here.

00:35:44.876 --> 00:35:46.161
So that wound of yours can heal.

00:35:52.596 --> 00:35:56.058
Hey, is the wound on
your hand better now?

00:35:56.266 --> 00:35:57.266
Yeah.

00:35:58.101 --> 00:35:59.376
My doctor’s really good.

00:36:16.286 --> 00:36:17.286
You know what?

00:36:17.704 --> 00:36:19.289
I’d forgotten the feeling.

00:36:20.193 --> 00:36:22.570
It’s really awful
when you lie, right?

00:36:35.055 --> 00:36:36.223
I never thought that

00:36:36.444 --> 00:36:38.891
the reason for my
first trip abroad is

00:36:39.101 --> 00:36:41.353
because I’m an accomplice in
an international cheating scheme.

00:36:41.603 --> 00:36:42.603
Hey!

00:36:46.692 --> 00:36:48.318
What did you tell your mom?

00:36:49.611 --> 00:36:52.364
I said I’m going to coach
junior high school students

00:36:52.364 --> 00:36:53.866
who will compete in
the Math Olympiad.

00:36:54.825 --> 00:36:55.825
You?

00:36:59.252 --> 00:37:00.795
My mom lives here now.

00:37:02.166 --> 00:37:03.484
She has a new family.

00:37:05.127 --> 00:37:07.337
We haven’t talked for years.

00:37:08.338 --> 00:37:11.466
But what my dad knows
is that I’ll just visit them.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:13.730
Is that true?

00:37:16.809 --> 00:37:17.809
Shall we go?

00:37:23.604 --> 00:37:24.578
What?

00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:26.477
Our test taker backed out?

00:37:26.565 --> 00:37:27.565
Of course not!

00:37:27.874 --> 00:37:29.052
Where did that come from?

00:37:29.443 --> 00:37:30.861
We’re not amateurs.

00:37:30.861 --> 00:37:32.571
Trust us, okay?

00:37:33.565 --> 00:37:34.565
Come on.

00:37:39.202 --> 00:37:41.455
I hope Lin and Bank are okay.

00:37:43.332 --> 00:37:44.333
They’ll be fine, hon.

00:37:45.584 --> 00:37:47.044
They know what’s at stake.

00:37:47.997 --> 00:37:48.997
Okay?

00:37:49.963 --> 00:37:53.592
I just hope that all of our
sacrifices pay off, you know?

00:37:53.759 --> 00:37:57.220
We worked too hard for
this and the risk is too high.

00:37:57.638 --> 00:37:58.655
Of course.

00:37:58.680 --> 00:38:00.283
Don't be too negative, hon.

00:38:00.515 --> 00:38:01.808
Professionals siya tayo.

00:38:03.226 --> 00:38:05.558
Hey, don't say that.

00:38:08.162 --> 00:38:09.162
I mean,

00:38:09.816 --> 00:38:11.693
we won't be doing
this forever, right?

00:38:11.914 --> 00:38:13.040
It's just this one time.

00:38:13.362 --> 00:38:14.296
Of course.

00:38:14.321 --> 00:38:15.321
Just one time.

00:38:16.949 --> 00:38:18.075
But us,

00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:19.951
forever.

00:38:21.161 --> 00:38:22.161
Okay?

00:38:23.997 --> 00:38:24.997
Wait.

00:38:25.541 --> 00:38:26.308
You

00:38:26.333 --> 00:38:28.502
ask me this again
with a ring, okay?

00:38:29.406 --> 00:38:30.270
And

00:38:30.295 --> 00:38:32.047
maybe after college?

00:38:33.173 --> 00:38:34.358
Of course.

00:38:34.383 --> 00:38:35.389
But,

00:38:35.926 --> 00:38:37.928
as if for a second I thought
I was gonna lose you.

00:38:39.846 --> 00:38:44.059
Especially when Bank
found out about what I did.

00:38:46.603 --> 00:38:47.854
I almost did.

00:38:49.564 --> 00:38:50.941
That was really foul.

00:38:54.194 --> 00:38:55.194
But,

00:38:55.779 --> 00:38:58.991
we all make mistakes
and wrong decisions

00:39:00.075 --> 00:39:03.120
and you're sorry for it
naman and I'm good with that.

00:39:05.372 --> 00:39:07.291
I believe that you're
a good person, Pat.

00:39:08.052 --> 00:39:08.767
Okay?

00:39:08.792 --> 00:39:10.377
And I won't give up on you.

00:39:11.795 --> 00:39:12.795
On us.

00:39:18.552 --> 00:39:20.053
And I promise you

00:39:20.295 --> 00:39:21.921
that I won't
disappoint you, hon.

00:39:42.242 --> 00:39:44.077
Good morning everyone.

00:39:44.703 --> 00:39:47.289
Welcome to the STIC exam.

00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:51.418
You may begin the
registration process.

00:39:54.504 --> 00:39:59.551
Please leave all your belongings
before entering the exam hall.

00:40:00.552 --> 00:40:03.889
And yes, that includes
your mobile phone.

00:40:06.391 --> 00:40:08.268
If you sneak them inside,

00:40:08.643 --> 00:40:09.728
we will know.

00:40:25.077 --> 00:40:28.747
Please observe the rules
and don't try to outsmart us.

00:40:28.872 --> 00:40:29.938
Excuse me.

00:40:30.165 --> 00:40:31.278
Do you still have
your cellphone?

00:40:31.792 --> 00:40:33.210
Please, surrender
it with your bag.

00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:34.851
Thank you.

00:40:35.545 --> 00:40:40.217
Every incident of
cheating in the STIC,

00:40:40.717 --> 00:40:43.178
has been dealt with accordingly.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:18.939
So how are the
answers going to get out?

00:41:18.964 --> 00:41:20.716
We'll bring spare phones.

00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:24.157
We'll hide the spare phones
inside the CR, in the toilet tank.

00:41:36.815 --> 00:41:37.816
Nona,

00:41:38.191 --> 00:41:39.734
can I speak with Lin?

00:41:40.819 --> 00:41:41.950
What are you talking about?

00:41:41.975 --> 00:41:43.839
How would Lin even get here?

00:41:44.355 --> 00:41:48.234
Vin, there's exactly an exam
right now at Sydney Center.

00:41:48.985 --> 00:41:51.696
You have 45
minutes allotted for it.

00:41:52.873 --> 00:41:55.375
And your time, now.

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:57.961
Today is a good day.

00:41:57.961 --> 00:41:58.545
Come in.

00:41:58.545 --> 00:42:01.339
So, anytime soon we're
gonna get the answers, okay?

00:42:01.715 --> 00:42:04.169
At this point, they should
be done with the exam.

00:42:11.183 --> 00:42:11.725
D.

00:42:11.725 --> 00:42:12.492
B.

00:42:12.517 --> 00:42:13.118
A.

00:42:13.143 --> 00:42:13.886
A.

00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.473
There was a slight delay.

00:42:18.148 --> 00:42:19.816
It's almost done.

00:42:19.816 --> 00:42:20.834
Always a delay!

00:42:20.859 --> 00:42:21.793
Promise!

00:42:21.818 --> 00:42:24.905
You're definitely getting into
some serious trouble here.
