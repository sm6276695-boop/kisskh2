00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:16.519
What's wrong?

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.519
Did you have a nightmare?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:25.799
Xixi.

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.599
I had a terrible nightmare.

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:31.079
Don't worry.

00:01:31.239 --> 00:01:32.040
It was just a dream.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.079
It's all over now.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.400
I'm here.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.439
You're safe.

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.599
I remember who you are.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.840
You're the wife of that famous artist.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.439
Right?

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.479
You've got the wrong person.

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:14.319
No, that's not right.

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.240
I'm sure I'm not mistaken.

00:02:15.439 --> 00:02:16.719
Your husband is Lu Ming.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.199
He's a handsome artist.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.520
I've seen news about you two.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.000
They said you divorced because of relationship issues.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.560
So it's all just marketing.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.639
The perfect power couple image.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.719
So did you actually get divorced?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.560
I saw online that it was your fault.

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.840
So was it you or him who cheated?

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.560
Tell me about it.

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:36.719
What are you doing?

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:40.759
I'm just chatting normally.

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:42.759
Does she look like she wants to talk to you?

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:49.400
Don't pay attention to her.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:50.360
Are you okay?

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.360
I'm fine.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:54.240
What happened to your hand?

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.039
She startled me just now.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.080
I accidentally scratched it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.319
Heavy rain pours down.

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:10.800
The street nearby is lit up.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.599
She curiously looks at everything in front of her.

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:17.879
Suddenly, she spots a girl in a red dress.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.560
Curled up not far away.

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:21.080
Her hair is soaking wet.

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.800
I remember you love watching the sunset.

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.319
Back when we weren't married yet,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.280
we often waited quietly for the sunset together.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.520
But I've forgotten

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.960
the last time

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.120
we waited like this until evening.

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.199
You seem distracted today.

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.879
Not really.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.879
Xixi,

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.000
do you think

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.040
believing you have a mission in this world

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.959
is a silly thing?

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.360
Is it foolish?

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.759
What do you mean?

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:28.639
Lately, I keep feeling

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.360
like I've forgotten

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.319
to do something really important.

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:36.680
You do have something important to do.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.079
You know,

00:04:38.519 --> 00:04:39.600
your novelâ€”

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:41.480
haven't you stopped writing lately?

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.279
When will you finish it and let me read?

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:45.639
I'm really looking forward to it.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.399
That might be true.

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:48.519
You're just too absorbed

00:04:48.519 --> 00:04:49.959
in your own novel world.

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:51.160
Thinking about all sorts of things.

00:04:58.759 --> 00:04:59.879
Actually, today

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.360
that girl Sasha said some

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.279
really strange things to me.

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:04.959
Just ignore that girl, okay?

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.399
But it's fine,

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600
she already left today.

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:09.560
She left?

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.240
When did that happen?

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.959
She just left.

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.319
But she was still here earlier today.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.639
Now it's finally peaceful.

00:05:42.319 --> 00:05:43.199
Who are you?

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:45.360
I'm Lu Ming.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:48.040
No, you're not.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.519
But sometimes,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.399
I am.

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.920
Why are you here?

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:59.199
I was wrong before.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.000
Can we start over?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:03.839
Go back.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.879
I don't want to.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Everything I do

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.079
is for you.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.800
You can't leave me like this.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.079
Why won't you let me go?

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:20.959
I've already told you.

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:22.680
I don't want to live with you.

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:23.879
Xu Xin.

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:26.560
I'm your husband.

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:28.639
I'm the one who loves you most.

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.800
You can't treat me like this.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.600
But I'm not your possession.

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:34.959
I have the right to choose my own life.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:35.920
You can't control me.

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:36.959
I'm not trying to control you.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.480
I'm doing this for a better life for us.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.439
But this isn't the life I want.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.160
I want freedom.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160
I want space.

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.560
I don't want to be tied down by you.

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:46.439
I'm tying you down?

00:06:47.279 --> 00:06:48.360
Did you forget?

00:06:50.399 --> 00:06:51.839
Who provides for this family?

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.480
And did you forget?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.920
Who takes care of you?

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
I haven't forgotten.

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.600
But that doesn't mean I should lose myself.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.680
Xu Xin.

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:06.439
You're too selfish.

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:09.160
You don't care about my feelings at all.

00:07:09.319 --> 00:07:11.199
Have you ever considered my feelings?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:14.199
You're always self-centered.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.399
You never listen to what I think.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.560
I don't need to fight for your suggestions.

00:07:18.959 --> 00:07:20.519
Because everything I've done for you

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.839
is for your own good.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:23.680
No.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.560
You don't know.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.279
You only care about yourself.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.839
All I know is that I love you.

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:35.439
Xu Xin.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.680
Let's go home.

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:41.279
I'm willing to change.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:44.000
I'll do anything for you.

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.399
Let's go home.

00:07:46.439 --> 00:07:47.199
Okay?

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:50.759
Lu Ming.

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.279
Stop using love to manipulate Xu Xin.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.000
That's not love at all.

00:07:55.319 --> 00:07:56.879
You just can't let go of your own sacrifices.

00:07:56.879 --> 00:07:58.160
The only person you love is yourself.

00:07:59.319 --> 00:08:00.120
With me here,

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.160
I won't let you hurt Xu Xin again.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.600
Mr. Lu.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:29.199
Mr. Lu.

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.959
Xu Xin's vital signs

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:32.519
are getting more stable.

00:08:34.879 --> 00:08:35.919
I think soon

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:37.080
she'll wake up.

00:08:38.159 --> 00:08:39.120
You can spend more time with her.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.200
I read novels to her every day now.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.440
I hope she'll wake up soon.

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:46.360
Talk to her more.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.279
It helps patients regain consciousness sooner.

00:08:51.639 --> 00:08:52.279
Thank you.

00:09:03.879 --> 00:09:04.919
Brother-in-law.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.360
Mom.

00:09:09.919 --> 00:09:10.879
Brother-in-law is here.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:15.919
Please leave.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.320
I don't want to see you.

00:09:20.679 --> 00:09:21.279
Aunt.

00:09:21.519 --> 00:09:22.399
I have something to tell you.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.039
It's about Xu Xin.

00:09:26.799 --> 00:09:29.600
The doctor said while Xu Xin is in a coma,

00:09:29.799 --> 00:09:31.279
she can still hear outside voices.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:34.000
If familiar people visit her,

00:09:34.279 --> 00:09:35.159
and talk with her,

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:37.000
maybe a miracle will happen.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.279
Aunt

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:47.840
I apologize to you.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:49.840
I'm sorry.

00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:54.279
Back then, I was young and impulsive.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.559
I acted stubbornly.

00:09:56.039 --> 00:09:57.240
I made a lot of mistakes.

00:09:58.399 --> 00:09:59.799
Including not listening to your advice.

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.279
But Xu Xin is innocent.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:06.320
Does saying this to me now change anything?

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.919
Isn't her situation now all because of you?

00:10:10.679 --> 00:10:11.440
Mom

00:10:15.519 --> 00:10:16.360
I came here this time

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.080
hoping you would visit Xu Xin.

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.200
I'm willing to do anything you ask.

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.200
Fine.

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:25.759
Isn't this why you came here?

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.320
Now I understand.

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.279
You can leave now.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.559
Every step Xu Xin took

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.799
was her own choice.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.919
Including marrying you.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:40.159
So the way she is now

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.120
is also her own doing.

00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.919
I won't go see her.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:52.559
Mom

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.000
Don't say that.

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.200
Brother-in-law, you should go back first.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:07.399
I'll try to talk to Mom.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:10.559
Thank you.

00:11:21.799 --> 00:11:22.600
Mom

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:52.440
I accidentally got scratched.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:02.159
Xu Xin

00:12:02.679 --> 00:12:03.879
I'm planning to go to town.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.120
Let me go with you.

00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:08.120
You just got out of the hospital.

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.200
Stay here and rest a bit longer.

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:14.360
Xu Xin, you have to trust me.

00:12:14.639 --> 00:12:16.799
I just don't want you to be in danger.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.559
Please wait here for me.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.480
Okay?

00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:45.639
Sir

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:48.360
Excuse me, how much longer until we reach town?

00:12:49.039 --> 00:12:49.559
Not far.

00:12:49.679 --> 00:12:50.559
It's just ahead.

00:12:55.639 --> 00:12:57.799
Sir, why has it taken so long?

00:12:57.799 --> 00:12:58.720
We're still in the mountains.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:00.679
When will we get to town?

00:13:00.879 --> 00:13:01.679
We're almost there.

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.000
Sir

00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.279
I don't need to go to town anymore.

00:13:10.279 --> 00:13:11.080
Please stop the car.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.320
I want to get out.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.799
Have you ever thought about leaving here?

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.960
Do you remember how you got here?

00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:58.960
Reality is a sickness.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:01.320
Illusion is the cure.

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.399
Xin Xin,

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.320
Mom is here to see you.

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:31.159
Can you hear me?

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:48.279
Mom, don't cry.

00:14:48.759 --> 00:14:50.080
She'll be okay.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.559
She's awake.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:18.720
Xixi.

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:22.039
What happened to me?

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:25.000
Maybe you were just too tired.

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.039
When I came back, you were already asleep.

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:27.759
No.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.159
That's not right.

00:15:30.799 --> 00:15:34.360
I remember I wanted to go to the market.

00:15:35.159 --> 00:15:36.799
Why do you want to leave here?

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.879
I told you it's not safe outside.

00:15:42.679 --> 00:15:44.960
But I realized I can't leave this place at all.

00:15:45.759 --> 00:15:47.120
Where is the market, really?

00:15:47.759 --> 00:15:49.200
Does this place even exist?

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.639
Maybe you just got lost.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.120
No, that's not it.

00:15:56.639 --> 00:15:57.519
Xixi.

00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:00.039
Where am I, really?

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:02.200
Why are you lying to me?

00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:03.720
What is this place, really?

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:05.080
What are you talking about?

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:08.399
Have you written so many novels that you've lost your mind?

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:11.919
I thought about it carefully.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:15.960
Everything I've experienced since I got here

00:16:16.799 --> 00:16:18.200
feels so unreal.

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.240
Everyone I've met here

00:16:21.559 --> 00:16:23.240
doesn't seem real.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.879
And everything that happens here

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:28.320
Let's go back.

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.120
all seem to be reminding me of something.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:33.799
You're overthinking it.

00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.840
How much business do we actually do?

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.360
I've never seen you take any money.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:43.159
A lot.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.440
Why is there a guesthouse here

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:45.600
in a place like this?

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:46.919
This isn't a tourist spot.

00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:49.720
Xu Xin, you're just too tired.

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.879
What are you really hiding from me?

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.320
I'm not hiding anything.

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:58.039
How long have you been hiding here?

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:01.480
Haven't you ever thought about leaving?

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.680
Xu Xin, are you okay?

00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:08.559
Is there anything else you can't tell me?

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:09.559
Xu Xin.

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:11.079
Stop overthinking things.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:11.880
Don't worry.

00:17:12.119 --> 00:17:13.400
I'm not hiding anything.

00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.000
Xixi, please tell me.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:16.480
Tell you what?

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.759
All of this.

00:17:19.279 --> 00:17:20.599
Why is all this happening?

00:17:21.839 --> 00:17:23.279
You're my best friend.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:25.119
I would never hurt you.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.799
It's wonderful here.

00:17:29.799 --> 00:17:30.799
But here,

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.920
it's so perfect, it doesn't feel real.

00:17:33.559 --> 00:17:35.240
I can't get hurt here.

00:17:36.359 --> 00:17:37.720
I don't feel any pain.

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.839
There's no sadness or suffering here.

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.160
Only happiness and joy.

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:54.000
But this isn't real.

00:17:56.039 --> 00:17:56.759
Is it?

00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.400
Xu Xin, stop talking.

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.039
Is this my dream?

00:18:02.839 --> 00:18:04.000
The real me

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:09.480
is still lying in a hospital bed, isn't she?

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:17.000
I want to leave.

00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:18.799
Don't you want to

00:18:18.799 --> 00:18:20.160
keep living here?

00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.279
Xu Xin.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:37.599
If you've really decided to leave,

00:18:38.359 --> 00:18:39.759
I respect your choice.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.359
And we

00:18:42.079 --> 00:18:43.960
will always have your back.

00:18:47.319 --> 00:18:48.160
Xixi.

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:51.519
Thank you.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.559
No matter what's outside that door,

00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:59.079
I have to face it.

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.160
All her vital signs are stable.

00:20:39.839 --> 00:20:41.240
Did Dr. Lou give any other instructions?

00:20:41.839 --> 00:20:42.640
Xu Xin.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.720
Go get the doctor, quick.

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:32.799
Xu Xin

00:21:33.759 --> 00:21:34.839
As I write this letter,

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.079
while I'm writing to you,

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.279
the doctor told me

00:21:40.119 --> 00:21:42.119
your brain activity is becoming more active

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:44.319
and you could wake up at any moment.

00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:48.680
I used to think that when you woke up,

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:51.000
seeing me by your bedside

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.079
would be a good thing.

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.319
But after reading your novel,

00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.400
I no longer feel that way.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.480
Now, I hope even more

00:22:02.079 --> 00:22:03.200
that your return this time

00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:05.920
will be a true new beginning.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.880
So I left this letter and the divorce papers

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:13.200
by your bedside.

00:22:15.279 --> 00:22:16.480
In your novel,

00:22:17.279 --> 00:22:18.160
the heroine faces

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:19.759
her husband bound inside a glass tank

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.559
and the killer standing before her,

00:22:22.359 --> 00:22:24.119
not knowing what to do.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:27.160
Yuan You, the root of all this tragedy,

00:22:27.839 --> 00:22:29.400
is also lost in confusion.

00:22:31.839 --> 00:22:32.640
Xu Xin,

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:35.279
when I read to this point in your novel,

00:22:36.279 --> 00:22:37.119
I wanted to write

00:22:37.119 --> 00:22:39.039
the ending I believe this story deserves.

00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.440
It may not be what you imagined,

00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:46.160
but maybe it can be a reference.

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:49.640
Yuan You looks at Xu Xin,

00:22:50.839 --> 00:22:51.839
seeing in her eyes

00:22:51.839 --> 00:22:53.319
the reflection of his own monstrous self.

00:22:53.599 --> 00:22:55.160
He suddenly understands something.

00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.720
His so-called love for Xu Xin

00:22:59.359 --> 00:23:01.079
was a shackle trapping them both.

00:23:01.079 --> 00:23:02.000
A heavy chain.

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.680
Within this chain,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.759
Yuan You gradually became

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:08.519
a monster he no longer recognized.

00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:12.839
Both he and Lu Ming

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.480
used the excuse of sacrifice

00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:19.000
to control the woman they claimed to love.

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.519
Yuan You realizes

00:23:23.279 --> 00:23:25.200
he has destroyed with his own hands

00:23:25.359 --> 00:23:28.400
everything he once longed and hoped for.

00:23:29.759 --> 00:23:31.559
Since nothing can be undone,

00:23:32.759 --> 00:23:34.799
at least for the one he loved all his life,

00:23:35.519 --> 00:23:36.839
there is still one thing he can do.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.720
The only thing left he can do.

00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:03.599
Inside the glass tank,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:07.119
Yuan You takes one last look at Xu Xin,

00:24:25.799 --> 00:24:28.079
then disappears without a trace,

00:24:29.759 --> 00:24:30.599
as if

00:24:32.039 --> 00:24:34.200
he had never existed in this world at all.

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:57.359
Lu Ming,

00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.960
Since I woke up,

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.519
it's been over a year.

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:06.160
City of Lies has been published.

00:26:07.359 --> 00:26:09.359
It uses the ending you wrote for me.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.480
A lot has happened during this time.

00:26:16.279 --> 00:26:17.640
I went to see my mother.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:20.599
She's changed a lot.

00:26:30.279 --> 00:26:31.559
I also met

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.240
an old friend I hadn't seen in years.

00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:37.200
After graduation, she went abroad for a few years.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.319
Now she's back too.

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:44.279
It's like we're back in our college days.

00:26:45.759 --> 00:26:48.119
Xiao Yi finally left Chen Fei.

00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:00.880
I don't know where to send this letter

00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:02.920
or where it should go.

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:05.599
I also don't know

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.079
if you'll ever receive it.

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:13.400
But I still want to write down

00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:15.400
what I wish I could say to you.

00:27:17.359 --> 00:27:18.160
Lu Ming,

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.440
I think you misunderstood one thing.

00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.359
In the novel, Xu Xin's life

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:33.799
doesn't become better just because Lu Ming disappears.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.559
It doesn't magically turn out well.

00:28:27.599 --> 00:28:30.039
No matter what path her life takes,

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.119
if she can't live as her true self,

00:28:35.599 --> 00:28:37.400
and break free from dependence on others,

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:39.799
then she will never

00:28:41.079 --> 00:28:42.160
be able to find

00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.920
her own inner peace.

00:29:08.319 --> 00:29:11.720
Love is only one part of life,

00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.359
but it's also irreplaceable.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.920
Maybe someday, somewhere,

00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.160
those meant to meet

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.119
will cross paths again.

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:47.559
Renowned artist Lu Ming

00:29:47.559 --> 00:29:49.359
