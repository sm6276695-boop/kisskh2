[The Promise of the Soul]

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.989
[Episode 12]
[It's You, Just You, Only You]

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.390
[That would be good.]

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.650
[Zefang can come back.]

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.950
[Ye Haiyuan,]

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.950
[take good care of Zefang.]

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.660
Xia Cha!

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.520
Cha!

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.920
Grandpa.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.500
Zefang.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.740
Why are you still here?

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.010
Go back now.

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.530
Go back to your body.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.650
Xia Cha!

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.890
Xia Cha, get up!

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.280
Cha!

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.230
Cha, wake up!

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.800
Cha!

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.120
Don't you dare leave me!

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.060
Grandpa, you were so easily fooled.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.930
I connected the red thread
from Haiyuan to Riqing,

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.330
and you even believed it.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.180
Cha!

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.480
Wake up!

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.200
[The red thread in your hand]

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.800
[has always been connected to Haiyuan.]

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.200
[After all that has happened...]

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:23.970
Cha!

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.300
[He's still found you.]

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.250
[After I give you my body,]

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.350
[take care of it.]

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.120
Cha!

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.240
Cha, wake up!

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:34.840
Cha!

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:35.600
[Goodbye,]

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.640
[Grandpa.]

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.579
[In this life,]

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.650
[you can start all over again,]

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.640
[carrying my happiness]

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.910
[with you.]

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:45.490
Cha!

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.090
Cha!

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.170
Cha, get up!

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.410
Cha!

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.290
Get up!

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.310
Ye Haiyuan!

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:04.430
Xia Cha.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.340
How could you jump down like this?

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.080
It's okay.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.030
I'm fine now.

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:16.670
Xia Cha.

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:19.160
No matter what happens,

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.910
you can't leave before me.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.690
So domineering.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.970
What gives you the right?

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:30.860
Because I

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.770
can't live without you.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:50.270
Luckily, he's fine.

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.190
Cha had a fight with Haiyuan.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.900
Why would he fall on purpose?

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.120
Let me ask you.

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.680
If one day,

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.700
my body is occupied by another soul,

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.670
will you continue to like me?

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.150
Why?

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.910
I mean, there could be an accident.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.400
Like one day, out of the blue,
there's a thunderbolt,

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.900
and then our souls swap.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:15.650
What do you mean?

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:16.740
I mean,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.720
if one day...

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.519
Chen Qiansui!

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:20.920
If that day comes,

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.770
I'll be the first one to come.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:25.420
I'll be the one who never leaves you.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.700
So don't act like you're running away.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.030
Since you've decided to be with me,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:30.230
you shouldn't take it lightly.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.970
I didn't.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:31.800
Don't smile!

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.870
Even though your smile is beautiful,

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:35.540
I must let you know

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:37.070
how I feel properly today.

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.070
Since junior high school,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.409
I've been the one who never gave up.

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:41.280
Every day from today on

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.880
will be the same as this, too.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.010
I've spent my most vibrant years of youth

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.850
with you.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.000
You have to take responsibility.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.040
What if I regret it

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.610
and don't want to take responsibility?

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.320
How can you regret it?

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.480
You can't regret it.

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:51.860
You've promised me.

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.800
Jiang Bailing.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.100
Now that I've stuck with you,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.560
you can't get away either.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.850
I've never thought of getting away.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.900
My name has "Bai" (100),
and your name has "Qian" (1,000).

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.010
Although your number is bigger than mine,

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.610
my love for you
is surely more than yours for me.

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.500
Let me carry you. Come on.

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.370
Keep kissing me like this,

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.740
until the end of the world!

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.150
You're not allowed to swim anymore.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.430
What if we go together?

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.800
Will it be fine then?

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:47.640
Fine?

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.110
What if I hadn't seen you?

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.130
What if I hadn't had time to save you?

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.740
You have no idea
how scared I was just now!

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.240
When you laid there,

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:59.050
you seemed dead.

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.640
You didn't answer when I called your name.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:02.540
If something

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.520
had happened to you,

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.710
I must catch Xia Zefang and...

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.010
Don't be angry.

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:11.360
Don't blame Zefang.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.810
Blame me if you must.

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.500
I spoiled him when he was young.

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:18.260
I gave him whatever he wanted.

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.660
But I forgot to teach him.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.040
Actually, he regretted it too.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.580
He was so sad to hear that

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.450
so many people blamed him

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.810
and didn't like him.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:32.350
On the contrary,

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:34.770
we should thank him

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.480
for letting us meet each other.

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:56.860
From now on,

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.470
don't take it off again.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.720
It's just a string.

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.720
What if it snaps?

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.180
If it snaps,

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.110
I'll braid a new one for you.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:15.990
I always think

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.430
the one who leaves first is happier.

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.830
Because leaving is a relief,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.620
and those who stay need to face regrets.

00:07:28.110 --> 00:07:29.310
But for you,

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.180
I will try my best

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:34.580
to be the last person to leave.

00:08:24.570 --> 00:08:25.230
Riqing.

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:52.590
I find

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:55.390
we are really alike.

00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:58.030
You lack love.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.230
I crave love.

00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.210
But we pursued it

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.660
in the wrong way.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.550
It seemed that we would find peace

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:13.110
only if the world felt sorry for us.

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.940
I'm really leaving.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.210
Thank you.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.430
Though,

00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.890
our relationship was so dramatic.

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:51.680
You'll meet someone
who really treats you well.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.630
By then,

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:58.800
be good to him.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.060
Guan Riqing.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:07.570
Bye.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.690
Zefang.

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:29.160
Xia Zefang.

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:31.760
Zefang.

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.530
I forgot to say

00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:41.660
that I really...

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:44.670
I really like you.

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:50.800
I really...

00:10:51.550 --> 00:10:54.220
Really like you.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.060
You came back from working out
so early today.

00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:26.540
Why do you take so much luggage back home
for the holiday?

00:11:28.950 --> 00:11:30.050
I'm going abroad

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:32.120
after this summer vacation.

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:53.400
Have some breakfast before you go.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:17.080
Why do you want to go abroad?

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:23.500
I'll have to take over the family business
eventually.

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.500
I have to catch up with the progress.

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:28.240
Where are you going?

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.680
How long will you stay there?

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:31.010
When will you come back?

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.770
Just take care of yourself.

00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.120
You talk too much.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:39.370
I'm not talking too much.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:41.600
I'm just concerned about him.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.460
I'm about to leave.

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:51.180
Take care.

00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:52.040
Bye.

00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.810
The car hasn't arrived yet?

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.590
The car is lost.

00:13:48.160 --> 00:13:49.060
You should go.

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:52.790
If I don't help put your luggage
in the car,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:53.990
Cha will nag about it.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:02.200
Well...

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:04.810
You go first.

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:11.340
Forget about the complex relationship
between us.

00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:12.570
It seems

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.470
we were too childish.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.660
You were childish.

00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:18.040
You started it all.

00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:20.070
Yes, I was too childish, alright?

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:30.960
Anyway, for some things,

00:14:32.130 --> 00:14:33.930
it's already too late to regret.

00:14:38.730 --> 00:14:39.900
Xia Zefang

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:42.530
has really gone, right?

00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:54.970
I missed it.

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:56.170
You got it.

00:14:57.150 --> 00:14:58.350
This kind of fate

00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:00.230
is rare.

00:15:01.230 --> 00:15:01.960
I hope

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:04.260
you two are doing well.

00:15:04.790 --> 00:15:06.190
Don't worry.

00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:08.050
We'll be fine.

00:15:29.230 --> 00:15:30.480
Don't embarrass yourself

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:31.610
after you go abroad.

00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:33.280
Be mature, okay?

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.130
It tickles.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:51.860
Did you miss me?

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:53.280
Miss you?

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.750
It's only been a few hours.

00:15:57.180 --> 00:15:58.000
Only?

00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:00.100
I've been waiting for you for so long.

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:04.230
Wait.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:05.450
I have a gift for you.

00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:10.320
What is it?

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:28.750
This thing

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:30.350
stores your past.

00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.940
Although I was not

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.160
in those memories,

00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:36.480
I'll keep them

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:38.080
for you.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:42.550
I'm sorry.

00:16:42.550 --> 00:16:43.820
I broke it.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:46.560
I've tried my best to restore it.

00:16:48.130 --> 00:16:48.730
Of course,

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.020
I guess my hands
just aren't skillful enough.

00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680
You're so clumsy.

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.280
You got hurt
even when you stuck the pieces together.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.890
I don't know if there's a past life,

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:13.230
but in this life,

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:16.500
let's grow old together.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:29.060
[Champion Xia Zefang]
[Champion Jiang Bailing]

00:19:50.130 --> 00:19:52.540
[Two years later]

00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:59.170
This one?

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:29.650
This suit is so expensive.

00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:31.540
Is Haru really giving it to us?

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:32.970
Yes.

00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.790
That's right.

00:20:53.490 --> 00:20:54.690
I finally understand

00:20:54.890 --> 00:20:56.990
why people like men in suits.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:01.930
Because they look handsome in them.

00:21:02.890 --> 00:21:03.760
Because I want

00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:05.730
to take them off one by one.

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:07.510
Someone's here.

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.880
Hi.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:37.150
Hi.

00:21:40.090 --> 00:21:41.020
Where are they?

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.940
I'm already here.

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:47.810
Am I wearing the wrong one?

00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:49.010
Isn't it a suit party?

00:21:49.370 --> 00:21:50.370
Where's your tie?

00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:54.250
I couldn't find it before I went out.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.290
Is it with you?

00:21:56.760 --> 00:22:00.420
It shouldn't be that strict for a party
with our own people, right?

00:22:01.090 --> 00:22:03.220
Or should I go to your room and find one?

00:22:04.250 --> 00:22:06.110
Why are you wearing this for work?

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:10.080
Why should I wear a suit
when I work as a physiotherapist?

00:22:10.270 --> 00:22:11.870
And you gave me this.

00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:21.370
So handsome,

00:22:21.370 --> 00:22:22.400
Qiansui.

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.040
I wonder

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:25.970
who was so late.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:27.100
What were you doing?

00:22:27.180 --> 00:22:28.440
None of your business.

00:22:28.830 --> 00:22:30.000
Alright, alright.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:33.110
Happy graduation

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:34.770
to three of you!

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:39.690
It's four.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:57.060
Happy graduation.

00:23:01.490 --> 00:23:03.950
What does our graduation
have to do with you?

00:23:04.370 --> 00:23:05.840
Why are you so stingy?

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.180
At the very least, I'm a new grad.

00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:08.820
Why?

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.080
Are you afraid that I'm so excellent

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.580
that you're no match for me?

00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.010
Stop arguing.

00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.080
I'll ship you two together
if you keep arguing.

00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.750
Okay.

00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.650
Since incestuous shipping is so popular
these days,

00:23:18.650 --> 00:23:20.050
I'll go after my brother.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.060
Haru and the others
will be late getting here.

00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:32.630
They've gone to register

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:33.890
so far this afternoon.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:35.980
Register for what?

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:37.080
Marriage.

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.620
Then we can also...

00:23:55.710 --> 00:23:58.240
Happy graduation!

00:23:58.260 --> 00:23:59.930
Classmates, happy graduation!

00:23:59.930 --> 00:24:00.990
Happy graduation!

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.700
Come on, look at me.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:12.210
Say something.

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:15.510
It's a good thing we found each other,

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:17.100
keeping our unfinished fate going.

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:18.340
It's not that it won't come.

00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.290
It's just that the time isn't right yet.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:21.260
Wait patiently.

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.630
-In this life.
-In this life

00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:23.590
-The next.
-The next.

00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.250
-And the one after that.
-And the one after that.

00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.760
Life is wonderful.

00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:34.080
You always meet the right person

00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.120
at the right time,

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:36.560
who is gonna save you

00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:37.490
and protect you.

00:24:38.610 --> 00:24:40.470
When you turn around, you'll find

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.940
the one who doesn't want anything from you

00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.600
and stays by your side quietly

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.580
can't be lost.

00:24:49.580 --> 00:24:51.180
We will meet, right?

00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.950
Before we meet,

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.350
we have to be fine

00:24:54.550 --> 00:24:55.680
for that day to come.

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:17.180
[Thank God for letting us meet
after I start all over.]

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:21.970
[I believe we'll meet again
in three lifetimes.]

00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.200
[Let's walk together into the future.]

00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:57.800
I'll give you five seconds,
then I'll start.

00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.810
I'll be faster than you later.

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.500
If you plan to play any tricks,

00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:02.610
just be careful.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:04.560
Start!

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.010
In this life,

00:28:40.650 --> 00:28:42.110
I found my feelings for you

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.050
too late,

00:28:44.650 --> 00:28:47.110
but I don't love you any less
than you love me.

00:28:48.030 --> 00:28:49.900
Although I'm older than you,

00:28:50.670 --> 00:28:52.340
we are the same

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:55.310
in terms of a romantic relationship.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:28:58.150
So,

00:28:59.130 --> 00:28:59.920
Haiyuan,

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:02.510
have a little more faith in me

00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.640
and be patient.

00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:08.440
I've set my mind

00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:10.110
on you.

00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:13.510
Don't go back on your word.

00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.690
I told you

00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:18.350
I'm as devoted as you.

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.990
If there's a past life,

00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.480
I must have spent much more time
waiting for you than you did.
