00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:33.319
Xu Xin

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.640
Xu Xin

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:40.000
Xu Xin

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.040
Xu Xin

00:01:43.519 --> 00:01:44.239
Xu Xin

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.560
Renowned artist Lu Ming and his wife were in a car accident.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.439
Lu Ming is now out of danger.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.120
His wife remains in a coma.

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:07.280
The cause of the accident is still under investigation.

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:49.400
Xu Xin

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.039
Can you hear me?

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.120
What happened that day was fate.

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.159
Maybe it doesn't want us to be apart.

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.159
Don't worry.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.719
I'll always be by your side.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.520
Always, no matter what.

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:53.439
Doctor.

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:55.560
Please tell me honestly.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.919
What's Xu Xin's condition right now?

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.759
Why hasn't she woken up?

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:02.159
Your wife's external injuries aren't very serious.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.560
She should recover from those soon.

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:05.599
But she's still unconscious.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.159
That's because her head injury is more complicated.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.319
What do you mean?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.080
Her head

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.919
was severely hit in the accident.

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:16.439
It's not life-threatening,

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.600
but it may be pressing on certain nerves.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.120
This has caused brain damage.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.720
And this damage is irreversible.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.920
Irreversible?

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.480
Yes.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.439
Yes.

00:04:31.279 --> 00:04:32.120
What will happen as a result?

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.279
Long-term vascular compression

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:35.839
can affect normal brain function.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.480
This mainly leads to cognitive decline,

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:40.639
reduced intelligence,

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:42.120
and emotional instability.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.160
Her condition may be more complicated than I thought.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.600
But please don't worry.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:47.959
Our hospital's medical equipment

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.120
is already the most advanced.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.720
Your wife is in the best ward.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.319
She has access to the most advanced equipment 24/7.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.759
She's under constant monitoring.

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:58.240
As for when she'll wake up,

00:04:58.639 --> 00:04:59.959
it depends on her own willpower.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.439
Because everyone's situation is different.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:05.360
Then what should we do?

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:07.279
Also,

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:09.199
family support is very important.

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:10.399
Spend more time with her.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.360
Sir,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.680
Sir,

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:20.040
Would you like to go back and get some rest?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.040
You've been here for several days now.

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:24.800
Your body can't take it.

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.399
No need.

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.000
I'll stay here with her.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.680
I feel more at ease watching over her.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:33.680
By the way,

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.920
I'll go home tomorrow to get something.

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:37.639
Thank you for taking care of her.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.800
Don't worry.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.240
This is your favorite dress.

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.759
I brought it for you.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.399
When you wake up,

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.680
let's put it on and dance, okay?

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:13.040
I know you can hear me.

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.199
You're just tired.

00:07:16.519 --> 00:07:17.920
You just want a good rest, right?

00:07:28.079 --> 00:07:28.800
In the past,

00:07:30.079 --> 00:07:31.879
you always said I didn't listen to you.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:35.439
When you wake up,

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.199
I'll really listen to you.

00:07:41.319 --> 00:07:42.240
No matter what you say,

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.639
I'll listen carefully to every word.

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.519
Xu Xin opens her eyes and looks at Lu Ming beside her.

00:08:28.519 --> 00:08:32.440
He feels both familiar and strange.

00:08:34.399 --> 00:08:36.039
Dr. Xu Ran tells her

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.279
that everything she sees is a hallucination.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.840
Yet the appearance of that man and child

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.080
seems to tell her

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:47.879
that all of this really happened.

00:08:58.759 --> 00:09:00.559
Every girl's disappearance

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.039
seems to be connected to her husband.

00:09:14.639 --> 00:09:17.279
And the only person in the world who believes her

00:09:18.559 --> 00:09:19.679
is Yuan You.

00:09:23.879 --> 00:09:25.919
But what Xu Xin doesn't know

00:09:26.559 --> 00:09:30.639
is that this man is the mastermind behind it all.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:12.720
When Yuan You was very young,

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:16.159
his father often took him hunting in the mountains.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:18.720
His father told him

00:10:19.639 --> 00:10:21.360
everyone should have

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:22.960
a little wooden cabin of their own.

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:29.360
In Yuan You's cabin,

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.879
there was only an empty glass tank.

00:10:35.159 --> 00:10:37.240
This was Yuan You's secret alone.

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.279
He would only share it with those closest to him.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:44.559
But when someone learned the secret,

00:10:45.679 --> 00:10:49.080
it was also the time they would leave Yuan You.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.320
So Yuan You was both special and lonely.

00:10:57.159 --> 00:11:00.360
The loneliness was so intense

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.480
it nearly consumed him.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.120
Xu Xin's arrival

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.960
changed everything.

00:11:18.639 --> 00:11:23.159
At first, he was doubtful about this encounter.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.360
Until that incident happened.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.840
That night,

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:53.080
Yuan You had a dream that felt too real.

00:12:03.799 --> 00:12:07.600
In the dream, he stood before Xu Xin.

00:12:08.759 --> 00:12:11.240
But she ignored him completely.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.639
After that,

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.679
Yuan You had a theory.

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.000
A hope.

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:50.080
He thought he had found

00:12:51.039 --> 00:12:53.279
someone who would end his loneliness.

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.639
Buying flowers for your girlfriend again?

00:12:57.120 --> 00:12:58.879
You two are really so loving.

00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:02.320
Yes.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.399
They're for my beloved.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:05.679
Thank you.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.720
Ms. Xu, your flowers.

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:36.840
In the dreams connected to Xu Xin,

00:13:37.919 --> 00:13:40.080
Yuan You got the information he needed.

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.720
He just needed one more confirmation.

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.759
Yuan You was one step away from proving

00:14:11.399 --> 00:14:13.159
he was no longer alone.

00:14:14.559 --> 00:14:16.759
All it took was a necessary sacrifice.

00:14:16.759 --> 00:14:18.039
I'm sorry.

00:14:26.279 --> 00:14:28.600
Little Tangyuan drew a girl.

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:34.960
Maybe I've seen her in my dreams.

00:14:43.679 --> 00:14:47.519
And so, Yuan You began his plan.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.600
He wanted Xu Xin all to himself.

00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.240
Even if it meant destroying

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.360
everything Xu Xin had.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.159
No one could stop him.

00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:01.519
Because in Yuan You's world,

00:15:02.039 --> 00:15:03.679
everything he did

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.360
had the highest motive.

00:15:07.399 --> 00:15:08.279
Called

00:15:09.159 --> 00:15:09.919
love.

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.320
Xu Xin,

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.519
when did you write this novel?

00:15:23.639 --> 00:15:25.879
I remember back in college,

00:15:27.279 --> 00:15:28.960
you said you loved literature.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:40.320
If you ever stopped dancing,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.759
you might try to become a novelist.

00:15:43.759 --> 00:15:45.279
To write the stories you wanted.

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.519
What I didn't know

00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:52.519
was that you actually did it.

00:15:54.159 --> 00:15:54.840
Xu Xin,

00:15:57.480 --> 00:15:58.559
how many more things

00:15:58.559 --> 00:16:00.039
do I not know about you?

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:04.919
Please wake up soon, okay?

00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:09.720
Wake up.

00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:10.679
Tell me everything you want to say

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:12.360
face to face, okay?

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.440
I finally found you.

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:23.960
Lao Lu,

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.519
You can't be so negative.

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.960
No one knows when Xu Xin will wake up.

00:16:28.399 --> 00:16:31.080
You'll need even more money in the future.

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.039
We have to keep going.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:34.519
Boss Ma said,

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.919
You two as a couple should still promote yourselves.

00:16:37.399 --> 00:16:38.399
That way,

00:16:38.399 --> 00:16:40.000
Even if people criticize you, it's not a loss.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.759
Being controversially famous is still fame.

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.559
Many artists don't have your advantages.

00:16:44.559 --> 00:16:45.000
You know that?

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:45.559
Forget it.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:46.320
Yeah.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:46.960
What about them?

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:47.759
If you want to let it go, then let it go.

00:16:47.759 --> 00:16:48.559
But who are you?

00:16:48.559 --> 00:16:49.360
You're Lu Ming.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:49.960
Xu Ran.

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.639
I mean, let's end things between us.

00:16:54.559 --> 00:16:55.759
When everything is over,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.720
I don't want to get involved anymore.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.440
No,

00:17:00.039 --> 00:17:01.279
Lao Lu, did I hear you right?

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.679
You're giving up all this money?

00:17:03.879 --> 00:17:05.039
Do you have something against money?

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:07.960
Xu Xin's treatment needs money.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.839
I can sell my house and patents.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.000
I'll sell everything valuable I own.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:12.839
I don't care.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:14.759
No,

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:16.079
With that attitude,

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:18.000
Why don't we try harder?

00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:19.359
Let's make a comeback.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:22.640
You don't understand how much Xu Xin means to me.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:23.799
She's so important.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:28.519
She's done so much for me.

00:17:29.559 --> 00:17:31.079
But I've only been taking from her.

00:17:32.279 --> 00:17:33.519
That was never my intention.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:35.960
At the beginning,

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:38.559
I just wanted to give her a better life.

00:17:39.279 --> 00:17:41.039
To prove myself to her family.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:45.799
Now it all seems ridiculous.

00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:49.079
I'm afraid of losing her,

00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.319
but I keep pushing her away.

00:17:56.599 --> 00:17:57.759
Now she's lying there.

00:17:58.799 --> 00:17:59.359
To her,

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:01.079
I'm just the one who hurt her.

00:18:01.079 --> 00:18:01.960
Do you understand?

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:06.599
But

00:18:08.599 --> 00:18:10.000
What if she never wakes up?

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.839
Will you regret it?

00:18:19.079 --> 00:18:20.039
I will regret it.

00:18:20.519 --> 00:18:21.640
In the name of love,

00:18:22.839 --> 00:18:23.920
I've been hurting her all along.

00:18:27.319 --> 00:18:28.599
I'll wait for her to wake up.

00:18:30.039 --> 00:18:31.079
After she wakes up,

00:18:32.599 --> 00:18:34.599
I'll let her choose the life she wants.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:37.400
That's the greatest relief for her.

00:18:38.279 --> 00:18:39.079
I understand.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.480
Lao Lu,

00:18:42.599 --> 00:18:43.599
You're my brother.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.319
Whatever you choose,

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:48.799
I respect you.

00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:51.440
Take care of yourself.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:53.119
What about you?

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.839
What are you going to do next?

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.519
Xu Xin wrote a novel.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:18:59.759
For a while,

00:19:00.359 --> 00:19:02.200
she often went to a bookstore to write.

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.359
I want to go there and see.

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.240
To really try to understand her.

00:19:36.079 --> 00:19:37.680
I know Miss Xu Xin.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.000
She works there every weekend.

00:20:53.319 --> 00:20:54.480
Yuan You step by step

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.359
led Xu Xin to Lu Ming.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.240
But at the last moment,

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.680
he slipped up.

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:08.200
I don't think I've ever told you

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.920
that girl was wearing red, right?

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.799
Yuan You.

00:21:18.799 --> 00:21:19.440
Let go.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.960
Yuan You.

00:21:20.319 --> 00:21:21.160
Let go.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.480
Why are you doing this to me?

00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.079
I've done so much for you.

00:21:28.079 --> 00:21:29.559
Why don't you trust me?

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.799
Why?

00:21:31.519 --> 00:21:33.519
Yuan You's grip tightened.

00:21:34.279 --> 00:21:35.559
He watched helplessly

00:21:35.559 --> 00:21:38.440
as the light faded from Xu Xin's eyes.

00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.960
At that moment,

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.559
memories flashed through his mind—

00:21:44.079 --> 00:21:46.039
the first time he met Xu Xin.

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:54.039
Xu Xin, Xu Xin, Xu Xin...

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:17.480
It was you.

00:22:21.799 --> 00:22:22.960
All along,

00:22:24.799 --> 00:22:25.720
it was always you.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.039
Always you.

00:22:34.079 --> 00:22:35.400
Yes, it was me.

00:22:38.039 --> 00:22:39.079
I did it all.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.519
Xu Xin, you wouldn't understand.

00:22:48.119 --> 00:22:49.960
Everything I did was because of you.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.079
All because of you.

00:22:53.359 --> 00:22:54.240
Because of us.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:58.200
Because I love you.

00:23:00.559 --> 00:23:02.119
No one loves you more than I do.

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.319
And you love me too, don't you?

00:23:05.559 --> 00:23:06.359
Otherwise, why would you

00:23:06.799 --> 00:23:08.680
do those things to me?

00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:13.079
You kept coming into my room.

00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.519
You kissed me first.

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:24.400
What did I

00:23:26.519 --> 00:23:28.039
ever do to you?

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:30.599
Yuan You.

00:23:31.559 --> 00:23:33.039
I've never kissed you.

00:23:47.119 --> 00:23:49.039
How did this crazy woman get here?

00:23:53.359 --> 00:23:54.240
Why are you here?

00:23:54.759 --> 00:23:55.960
What are you talking about?

00:23:57.359 --> 00:23:58.559
Are you too tired?

00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.160
Don't touch me.

00:24:00.839 --> 00:24:02.319
If you're not in the mood,

00:24:02.759 --> 00:24:04.039
I'll just go back to my room.

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:08.680
Xu Xin.

00:24:09.519 --> 00:24:10.400
Xu Xin.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.079
I told you, you can call me Xu Xin.

00:24:26.759 --> 00:24:27.640
Get out.

00:24:28.839 --> 00:24:29.599
Get out.

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:30.880
Get out.

00:24:42.759 --> 00:24:44.759
I told you, you can pretend I'm someone else.

00:24:45.519 --> 00:24:46.519
But Yuan You,

00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:49.200
I really think you're sick.

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:51.079
You need to see a doctor.

00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:54.799
Xu Xin.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:24:58.119
I know there's still distance between us.

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:15.839
But just now,

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:20.960
I really wanted to kill you.

00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.759
I don't know what else I can do.

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400
I've done everything I could.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.599
Not every effort

00:25:41.279 --> 00:25:42.359
will be met with love.

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:48.359
Xu Xin

00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.440
Your novel stops abruptly at this point.

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.039
Clearly, you haven't

00:26:55.039 --> 00:26:56.640
had the chance to put a period at the end.

00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.400
Why did you write a novel like this?

00:27:03.119 --> 00:27:04.279
I have a feeling

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.000
that everything about us is hidden in this story.

00:27:10.559 --> 00:27:12.279
Let me return to where it all began.

00:27:13.559 --> 00:27:15.599
To see the truth behind everything.

00:27:23.079 --> 00:27:23.880
Excuse me, student.

00:27:24.079 --> 00:27:26.240
I remember your name is Lu Ming, right?

00:27:26.599 --> 00:27:27.240
Yes.
