00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:06.560
Where did you go?

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.800
It wasn't me who left you.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.280
It was you who left me.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.800
Us.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.680
You and Xiao Yi.

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.280
How do you know Xiao Yi?

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.639
Because we've always been together.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.879
Always together.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.280
Yes.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.120
Always together.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.120
Always.

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:45.000
Together.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.919
What's wrong?

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.039
Xu Xin.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:02.080
Look at me.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.240
Xu Xin.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.800
You don't need to be afraid.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.560
No one will hurt you here.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.919
I had a nightmare.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:35.159
That's a manifestation of your anxiety.

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.919
Don't worry about it.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.680
I'm sorry.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.719
None of this was supposed to involve you.

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.800
Let me handle the rest myself.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:02.919
I told you I'd help you.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.960
I won't leave you.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.279
But I don't want to drag you into this anymore.

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.079
Do you still think you're dragging me down?

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.600
Get some more sleep.

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:33.399
I'll stay with you.

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:02.480
You're awake.

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:03.560
Have a seat first.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:08.600
I made breakfast.

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:09.560
The conditions are limited.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:13.160
Thank you.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.240
The eggs are a bit overcooked.

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:17.600
It's the way you like them.

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:21.160
How did you know?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.160
I like my eggs a little burnt.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:26.160
You mentioned it casually during therapy.

00:06:40.959 --> 00:06:41.920
What are your plans next?

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.319
I want to go somewhere later.

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:12.639
Yuan You.

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:15.399
I'm scared.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.439
I'm afraid Xixi is like them.

00:07:25.959 --> 00:07:26.560
Don't worry.

00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:28.360
I'm here.

00:07:44.399 --> 00:07:45.160
Is anyone here?

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:47.839
Hello.

00:07:47.839 --> 00:07:49.160
We're not open yet.

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:52.839
Do you know Xixi?

00:07:54.079 --> 00:07:54.680
Yes.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:58.160
Do you know where she went?

00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.959
Are you her friend?

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.639
You probably haven't been in touch for a while, right?

00:08:05.399 --> 00:08:06.680
Why do you ask?

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:09.439
This bar was opened by me and Xixi's friends

00:08:09.439 --> 00:08:10.160
together.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:11.879
But...

00:08:13.439 --> 00:08:14.639
She passed away two years ago.

00:08:19.399 --> 00:08:21.680
Two years ago, we all started this business together.

00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:22.480
We opened this bar.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.399
There was a wine tasting event back then.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.199
We all decided to go together.

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.600
But Xixi said she wanted to go alone.

00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.839
I don't know what happened in between.

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.480
I only know her car

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.080
was rear-ended by a truck.

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:36.679
Xixi.

00:08:36.799 --> 00:08:38.039
But I couldn't reach you at all.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.519
I changed my phone number.

00:08:39.519 --> 00:08:41.440
I'm the person who knows you best in this world.

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.360
If you need me,

00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.960
I'll be by your side right away.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.039
She died two years ago.

00:08:45.279 --> 00:08:46.679
We attended the memorial together.

00:08:46.799 --> 00:08:48.720
All of us went to her funeral.

00:08:49.159 --> 00:08:50.360
Everyone was heartbroken.

00:08:51.399 --> 00:08:52.120
It's been two years.

00:09:02.919 --> 00:09:03.840
What did you just say?

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:08.720
I said I refuse.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:11.639
Dr. Xu.

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:14.320
Say that again.

00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.919
Everything that's happened to you today

00:09:21.919 --> 00:09:23.440
is all your own doing.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.200
What about Xu Xin?

00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.519
Who will take responsibility for Xu Xin's life?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.000
I really regret doing so many bad things for you.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.399
I won't do it again.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.559
Are you kidding?

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:52.279
Don't forget you took the money.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.679
And I have leverage over you.

00:09:54.679 --> 00:09:55.559
Do as you please.

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.799
I'll take responsibility for what I should.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000
I won't run away from it.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.279
Are you sure you want to risk your career?

00:10:11.399 --> 00:10:12.799
If that day really comes,

00:10:14.799 --> 00:10:18.000
I'll accept whatever punishment I deserve.

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:21.879
Is there anything else?

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.000
If not,

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:26.399
you can leave now.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.039
Dr. Xu.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.360
You'll regret this.

00:10:54.039 --> 00:10:55.200
Are you sure you want to do this?

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.960
I'm wondering if Xixi is just my hallucination.

00:11:02.399 --> 00:11:04.159
Those three people who disappeared before,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:07.440
although I don't know what method Lu Ming used,

00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:11.440
but after they disappeared,

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.399
it's like they never existed in this world.

00:11:14.759 --> 00:11:16.320
The bar owner also said he saw Xixi.

00:11:16.759 --> 00:11:18.240
That proves she really existed.

00:11:20.039 --> 00:11:21.399
Xixi really is different from them.

00:11:22.279 --> 00:11:24.399
And Lu Ming said the same thing as the bar owner.

00:11:25.759 --> 00:11:28.320
But I really saw her.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.879
Even though I don't want to admit it,

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:36.679
what happened with Xixi

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.120
has made me start to doubt myself.

00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:40.120
Am I really sick?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.279
Is everything I'm seeing just an illusion?

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:50.399
Do you really trust me?

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.320
Okay.

00:11:57.320 --> 00:11:58.080
Let's begin.

00:12:03.919 --> 00:12:04.759
Close your eyes first.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.159
Relax your body.

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:11.000
Follow my rhythm.

00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:13.399
Inhale.

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:16.960
Exhale.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.039
What do you hear?

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:33.360
Sound of waves

00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:35.679
So, what did you remember?

00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:37.840
Lu Ming said

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.440
his father used to be a fisherman.

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.879
For a long time in his childhood,

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.080
he lived by the sea.

00:12:49.279 --> 00:12:49.879
Xu Xin

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.840
Now there's a door in front of you.

00:12:55.519 --> 00:12:56.360
You approach it.

00:12:59.120 --> 00:12:59.799
Open it.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.600
Lu Ming

00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:26.559
I can't live like this anymore.

00:13:30.039 --> 00:13:31.200
Let's separate.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.879
I won't leave you.

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.240
Ms. Xu

00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:54.960
Ms. Xu

00:13:57.399 --> 00:13:58.000
Ms. Xu

00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.440
This is as you requested,

00:14:00.759 --> 00:14:02.279
the drafted divorce agreement.

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:04.559
Thank you.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:07.600
Allow me to confirm with you.

00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.559
Are you sure you want to give up all assets?

00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:12.759
According to the law,

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.320
you are entitled to half

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.519
of the marital property.

00:14:18.679 --> 00:14:19.360
I'm sure.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:21.879
Ms. Xu

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.600
That's a substantial amount.

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:26.639
Your husband is now a well-known artist.

00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.480
He owns a lot of assets.

00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:31.519
Are you really sure you want to give it up?

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.000
This is enough.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.440
He earned the money.

00:14:37.519 --> 00:14:38.320
Let him keep it.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.600
Alright, Ms. Xu.

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.200
This agreement

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:44.200
will take effect after you and your husband sign it.

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.200
It will then be valid.

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.399
Fortunately, you two have no children.

00:14:47.679 --> 00:14:48.960
That makes things much simpler.

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:51.399
Yes.

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:05.759
Xu Xin

00:15:06.519 --> 00:15:07.080
Xu Xin

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:08.559
Xu Xin

00:15:11.799 --> 00:15:12.399
Xu Xin

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:14.360
Xu Xin

00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:16.399
Xu Xin

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.440
I divorced Lu Ming.

00:15:29.519 --> 00:15:30.960
He used the car accident

00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.120
to try to make me forget everything.

00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:44.080
What happened to your face?

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:45.759
Why are you so late?

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.879
This is my new piece that will be exhibited soon.

00:15:50.399 --> 00:15:51.080
It's called "Homecoming."

00:15:52.039 --> 00:15:53.600
It's also related to my wife.

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:56.240
But she's not feeling well today.

00:15:56.919 --> 00:15:57.799
She couldn't make it.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.639
The inspiration this time is similar to my last work.

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:03.799
Should we take it as a creative block?

00:16:03.799 --> 00:16:05.120
Are you facing a bottleneck in your work?

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.600
I saw your wife not long ago.

00:16:10.679 --> 00:16:11.759
She was quick-witted.

00:16:11.759 --> 00:16:12.639
Very sharp-minded.

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:14.519
She didn't seem unwell at all.

00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:18.000
But the wound on your face looks recent.

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:20.679
Can you tell us what happened?

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.840
I just accidentally fell.

00:16:24.639 --> 00:16:25.399
It's nothing serious.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.919
Time and again,

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:31.960
you market yourselves as a loving couple.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.360
But on the other hand,

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.240
you keep your wife hidden.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:36.320
You don't let the public see her.

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.320
You really know how to work the market.

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:43.679
And the theme this time is "Homecoming."

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:45.759
Does that mean your marriage is in trouble?

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.799
Do you need a fresh start?

00:16:49.279 --> 00:16:50.600
We've heard a saying,

00:16:51.679 --> 00:16:53.799
"Marriage is the grave of love."

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.240
My wife and I went from passionate love to marriage.

00:16:57.919 --> 00:17:00.200
To outsiders, it may seem like we've reached the end.

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:02.440
The name of this piece

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:04.680
is about finding, within marriage,

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.000
a sense of belonging for my wife and me.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:12.880
That's completely different from what your wife said.

00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:15.519
Before your car accident,

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.599
your wife had already filed

00:17:17.599 --> 00:17:18.960
for divorce in court.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.680
But you took advantage of her amnesia

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.839
and tried to keep her living with you

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:25.319
under false pretenses.

00:17:26.079 --> 00:17:27.960
That's extremely despicable and shameless.

00:17:29.279 --> 00:17:31.359
Your marriage is completely broken.

00:17:31.599 --> 00:17:32.720
Do you have any response?

00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:37.200
Ms. Lin,

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:38.839
this isn't what we agreed on before.

00:17:38.839 --> 00:17:39.480
It's different now.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:41.160
We have to end this interview.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:42.720
Mr. Lu,

00:17:43.279 --> 00:17:44.599
have you come up with any ideas?

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.440
I'm still thinking.

00:17:50.519 --> 00:17:51.359
Still thinking.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.160
We're running out of time.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.240
If investors don't see results soon,

00:17:57.599 --> 00:17:58.720
they'll pull their funding.

00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:03.599
Will you take the loss or will I?

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.039
I have a wife and kids.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.240
I have a family to support.

00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.240
Have a drink.

00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:47.599
It might make you feel better.

00:18:49.079 --> 00:18:49.759
Thank you.

00:18:57.599 --> 00:18:58.640
Not many people know about this place.

00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.240
It's very safe.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.640
Did you build this cabin?

00:19:07.319 --> 00:19:08.960
Why are you in this forest?

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:09.960
With a place like this?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.519
My father left it to me.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.160
So did your family use to live nearby?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.480
In a small town not far from here.

00:19:20.599 --> 00:19:22.079
So this is your hometown.

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.359
I'm very familiar with it.

00:19:27.519 --> 00:19:28.799
I really like the forest here.

00:19:29.359 --> 00:19:31.279
I used to play in the forest a lot as a child.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:34.160
I always felt calm in the woods.

00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:35.759
Some people say

00:19:36.519 --> 00:19:38.759
time passes very slowly in the forest.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:41.119
So I always enjoyed that time.

00:19:41.799 --> 00:19:43.640
It felt like time would actually stop.

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:48.039
But that's just an illusion during the day.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.400
At night,

00:19:50.759 --> 00:19:52.519
the forest shows its true nature.

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:56.920
Once, I went to play in the forest

00:19:57.599 --> 00:19:59.640
and ended up staying until late at night.

00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.279
It got completely dark.

00:20:02.039 --> 00:20:02.799
I got lost.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:07.599
The forest at night is really scary.

00:20:08.839 --> 00:20:11.160
The darkness feels like it can swallow everything.

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:15.440
I still can't forget

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:16.599
the fear I felt back then.

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.000
I was really, really scared.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.160
But gradually,

00:20:22.559 --> 00:20:24.000
I started to enjoy that feeling.

00:20:25.839 --> 00:20:27.079
It's hard to describe.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:28.880
Maybe

00:20:30.079 --> 00:20:32.880
I was just convincing myself.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.039
To overcome the darkness,

00:20:35.759 --> 00:20:37.319
you have to become the darkness.

00:20:42.759 --> 00:20:44.279
Later, my father found me

00:20:45.319 --> 00:20:46.519
and brought me to this cabin.

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.440
He built this cabin in secret.

00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:50.720
Even my mother didn't know.

00:20:51.559 --> 00:20:52.720
He asked me to keep it a secret.

00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.359
He said every man

00:20:56.319 --> 00:20:58.160
should have a place of his own.

00:20:59.519 --> 00:21:00.559
So after that,

00:21:01.279 --> 00:21:02.799
this became our secret base.

00:21:03.519 --> 00:21:04.640
We used to come here often.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.720
Fishing, exploring, hunting.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.839
Your childhood sounds pretty interesting.

00:21:15.599 --> 00:21:16.279
What about you?

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.559
How was your childhood?

00:21:23.359 --> 00:21:26.119
My parents met through a matchmaker.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:29.839
They didn't have much back then.

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.000
Our family wasn't well-off.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.599
But my mother was very smart.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.720
With her help,

00:21:38.440 --> 00:21:39.880
my father started a business.

00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.359
After that, our situation

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.680
kept getting better.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.000
But just when everything

00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.400
was going well,

00:21:52.359 --> 00:21:54.240
my father started neglecting his work.

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.839
Then they got divorced.

00:22:00.319 --> 00:22:02.599
My mother insisted on raising me herself.

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.839
My father abandoned us.

00:22:10.319 --> 00:22:11.039
After that,

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.559
he disappeared completely.

00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:18.880
My father's leaving was a huge blow to my mother.

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:21.759
Raising me alone,

00:22:22.839 --> 00:22:24.160
she became more and more irritable.

00:22:25.079 --> 00:22:25.920
Since I was little,

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.400
I had to obey my mother's strict rules.

00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:32.880
Under her supervision,

00:22:33.519 --> 00:22:35.200
I had to do everything perfectly.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:38.400
Everything I did

00:22:40.599 --> 00:22:42.119
needed her approval.

00:22:43.039 --> 00:22:44.599
But I still ended up with Lu Ming.

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.240
After I told my mother,

00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:50.079
she was furious.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.559
She even locked me in my room.

00:22:53.839 --> 00:22:56.960
She even yelled at me,

00:22:58.680 --> 00:22:59.880
saying I was unworthy to be her daughter.

00:23:08.079 --> 00:23:08.799
But in the end,

00:23:08.799 --> 00:23:10.319
I still chose to marry Lu Ming.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.359
After that,

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:15.680
my mother never contacted me again.

00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:20.319
Sometimes I wonder

00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:22.799
maybe my mother was right.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.440
If I had listened to her back then,

00:23:28.279 --> 00:23:29.599
would things be different now?

00:23:30.799 --> 00:23:32.640
What kind of life would I be living?

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:35.920
Maybe all along,

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.759
I never really understood Lu Ming.

00:23:40.839 --> 00:23:42.680
Everyone has secrets in their heart.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.119
Just like my father said,

00:23:46.759 --> 00:23:47.759
everyone should have

00:23:48.519 --> 00:23:49.880
a little cabin in their heart.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.880
Don't you think?

00:24:01.319 --> 00:24:02.359
Then your father

00:24:02.519 --> 00:24:04.079
why did he build this cabin?

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.359
Did he have secrets too?

00:24:08.319 --> 00:24:09.519
My dad loved hunting.

00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:11.720
He often took me with him when I was little.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.759
But mostly,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.279
it was just pheasants and rabbits.

00:24:17.079 --> 00:24:17.960
But once,

00:24:18.599 --> 00:24:19.400
we caught

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.920
a really huge wild boar.

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.640
We brought it here to butcher.

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.480
He was just an ordinary man.

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.559
He had a happy family.

00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:35.240
Living in a pleasant countryside.

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.400
But he needed a place to let off steam too.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.480
I think Lu Ming is the same.

00:24:48.279 --> 00:24:49.759
So in your cabin,

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.160
what do you have?

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:02.880
It's just a regular cabin.

00:25:14.119 --> 00:25:15.839
You still have the mood to drink?

00:25:16.119 --> 00:25:16.960
Do you know

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:19.200
our investors are about to pull out?

00:25:20.279 --> 00:25:21.880
Several investors have already drafted contracts

00:25:22.119 --> 00:25:23.359
to sue you for breach of contract.

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.160
That article is fake.

00:25:26.319 --> 00:25:27.400
Who cares if it's real or not?

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:28.559
Netizens think it's true.

00:25:28.559 --> 00:25:29.559
So it's true.

00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:31.559
Give me a little more time.

00:25:32.359 --> 00:25:33.480
I know who wrote it.

00:25:35.119 --> 00:25:36.000
I'll get her to take it down.

00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.480
Even if you take the article down now,

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.400
public opinion can't be reversed.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.079
Go talk to them again.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.920
I've made them so much money.

00:25:46.559 --> 00:25:47.880
The investors said

00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:50.680
they can accept an artist's work

00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.039
even if the market response is poor,

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.440
right? Even losing money.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.440
But they absolutely won't accept

00:25:55.519 --> 00:25:56.559
an artist accused of misconduct.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.400
Mr. Lu,

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:00.279
I can't work with you anymore.

00:26:01.079 --> 00:26:02.079
If I keep working with you,

00:26:02.319 --> 00:26:04.839
all my resources will be swallowed by this incident.

00:26:07.279 --> 00:26:08.440
Is there no other way?

00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.599
There is.

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:10.640
What about Xu Xin?

00:26:10.799 --> 00:26:11.839
I've already arranged the reporters.

00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.160
Even if she's dead,

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:14.720
you have to cry over her body for me.

00:26:16.079 --> 00:26:16.440
You...

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:17.640
Say that about Xu Xin again,

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.440
and you'll be the first to go.

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:21.200
Get out.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.200
Your wife has already filed

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.599
for divorce in court.

00:26:37.799 --> 00:26:40.000
Your marriage is completely broken.

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.720
Is this what you call effort?

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.880
Effort to weave a perfect lie.

00:26:53.759 --> 00:26:54.400
Xu Xin.

00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:56.519
Xu Xin.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.200
I brought you some water.

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.240
Yuan You.

00:27:33.079 --> 00:27:34.000
If it weren't for you,

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.559
I might still be doubting myself.

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:39.559
Maybe I wouldn't even know who I am anymore.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:35.880
Yuan You

00:28:40.759 --> 00:28:41.480
Yuan You

00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.440
Why are you still awake?

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.799
Are you heading out?

00:28:47.519 --> 00:28:48.519
The welfare home called.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.720
A child has a fever.

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:50.680
I need to go back.

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.599
Then get some rest early.

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:55.720
Okay
