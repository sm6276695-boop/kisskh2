[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 30]

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.280
So I will

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.640
take Li Shuang away
from Yunjing as soon as possible.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.350
Su Muyang

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.120
fears the Changfeng Army's power,

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.640
so he won't dare move against you.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.840
What if Shuang refuses?

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.280
As long as you don't stop me,

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.150
I'll find a way.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.479
And if I do stop you?

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.900
Then I'll stick around until you give in.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.910
Good.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.220
Only someone with your character

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.960
can truly protect her.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.590
Shuang insists on returning to the capital

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.230
because she doesn't want to implicate
the Li family and the Changfeng Army.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.120
She always feels she owes me her life.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.520
Loyalty, filial piety, propriety,
and righteousness—

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:32.840
these values that shaped her

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.700
are also close to destroying her.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.520
Right now,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.280
only you can break

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.740
these deadly constraints

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.050
and set her free.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Grand General, I won't let you down.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.410
This Dragon Sword
has been with me for years.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.940
Today, I give it to you

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.280
as a gift

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.020
for your future wedding with Shuang.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.400
From now on,

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.860
keep her safe for me.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.430
If she refuses to leave

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.890
and keeps being stubborn,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.680
show her this sword and tell her,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.560
"You are Li Wei's daughter."

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.270
If she enters the palace,

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.800
she'll only become a hostage,

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.280
a pawn His Majesty will use

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.910
to purge or control me.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.720
Only if she escapes far away

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.750
will I be free of worry.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.200
I understand.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.950
I won't disappoint you, Grand General.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:42.470
Master,

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:43.770
as you instructed,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.079
the flag has been cleaned

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:45.670
and restored completely.

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.720
[Annan]

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.150
This is the military flag
of the Black Armor Army

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.740
under Prince Annan Duan Aodeng
of Yao State.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.130
Back then, during the Battle of Lucheng,

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.750
when the Emperor of Yao State
reached the border area,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.270
I led a team

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:08.960
to pursue him.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.810
Grand General,

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.540
the wheel tracks lead that way.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.310
This is our only chance to capture
the Emperor of Yao State alive.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.790
You guys stay here.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:20.160
If we haven't returned

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.350
by dawn,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.650
go back to camp and report.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.510
Grand General!

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.160
This mission

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.250
is certainly perilous,

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.140
but if it can end the war
between the two nations,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.230
it will be a blessing.

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.100
This is
the Emperor of Yao State's carriage.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.580
Let's split up and surround them.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:19.920
Duan Aoze.

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.310
Li Wei?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.120
Today, my victory may not be honorable,

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.290
but for the sake of all people,

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:28.740
I must capture you alive.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:48.760
At present,

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:51.020
Yao State has sent envoys
to negotiate peace.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.550
There are some conditions
we cannot concede,

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.390
but we should return prisoners of war

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:56.510
to show sincerity.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:05:59.270
This military flag

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:00.950
will be returned as well.

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.870
What's wrong with you?

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:09.770
Forgive my rudeness.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.160
I suddenly feel unwell.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.000
I'll take my leave first.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.800
Come and catch me!

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.480
Wait for me!

00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.870
I'm coming for you! I'm coming for you!

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:29.480
Hurry up!

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.310
Aodeng,

00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:34.440
are you alright?

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:41.120
Long live Your Majesty!

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.909
This military flag

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.240
is also a trophy taken that day.

00:08:07.310 --> 00:08:08.970
Did you really see it clearly?

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.640
I dare not speak recklessly.

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.370
Though that person's behavior

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.310
was completely different
from Prince Annan,

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.630
their voice and appearance

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:17.830
were very similar.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.430
This matter is extremely serious.

00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:20.950
Therefore,

00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:23.410
I rode back as fast as I could
to report to you.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.390
How did he react

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.030
when he saw you?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.690
He was indifferent.

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.480
So I couldn't confirm his identity.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:36.909
However,

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:39.510
he seems to have some conflict

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.970
with the Emperor of Taijin

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.840
because of General Li Shuang

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.100
of the Changfeng Army.

00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.110
Jin Wujian hasn't returned to report yet.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.680
He is most likely already dead.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.960
This person must certainly be Duan Aodeng.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:57.760
Since we can no longer control
the shadow puppet,

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.430
I absolutely cannot let him
return alive to Yao State.

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.520
Your Majesty,

00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:13.140
although we declared early on
that Prince Annan was dead,

00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:14.840
his former supporters in the court

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:16.240
have never accepted it

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:18.760
and have been secretly searching for him.

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.400
His Majesty is still young

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:22.310
and his position is not yet secure.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:24.710
Whether this person is Prince Annan
or not,

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.760
I think

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.840
we cannot afford to be careless.

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:42.120
You just said

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.600
Su Muyang had a falling out with him

00:09:45.270 --> 00:09:47.070
because of that female general?

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.720
Yes.

00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:52.030
Everything in the world—

00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.200
even when two nations clash—

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.270
seeks

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:59.030
only advantage.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.750
As long as my offer is generous,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:05.030
I believe

00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:08.750
Su Muyang will be willing to help me
with this favor.

00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.840
You're wise, Your Majesty.

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.520
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.480
Your Majesty,

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:20.870
regarding the case of Jia Shihong
embezzling disaster relief funds,

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:22.150
after thorough investigation,

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.950
the evidence is now conclusive.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:24.820
Your Majesty,

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.970
why are you hesitating to convict him?

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.960
The judgment

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:29.710
of this case

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:31.180
rests with His Majesty.

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:33.440
You have repeatedly interfered

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.360
and spoken disrespectfully

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:35.490
before His Majesty.

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:36.610
Are you

00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.520
intending to rebel?

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.920
Throughout history,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.920
any wise ruler

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:50.280
would first share the worries
of the people.

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.390
The disaster relief case

00:10:51.390 --> 00:10:52.580
concerns the livelihood of the people.

00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:53.580
Your Majesty,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:55.960
please do not fear the powerful officials

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:58.220
and allow the law to be applied unfairly.

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:01.080
Your Majesty,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.410
please do not fear the powerful officials

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.700
and allow the law to be applied unfairly.

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.140
Ministers, there is no need to argue.

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.070
I have already made my judgment.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:21.000
Jia Shihong, governor of Jiuqing County,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.930
abused his power for personal gain

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.270
and embezzled disaster relief funds.

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:27.070
The charges have been verified.

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:28.390
Effective immediately,

00:11:28.390 --> 00:11:29.640
he will be dismissed, investigated,

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:31.570
and all his property confiscated.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.670
His relatives

00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.270
and clansmen

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.480
will be executed for the same crime

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:43.100
as a warning to others.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:47.550
Your Majesty.

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:50.430
Your Majesty!

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:55.440
Let go of me!

00:11:55.650 --> 00:11:56.550
I am the Prime Minister.

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:58.610
How can I be arbitrarily implicated?

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:05.400
Prime Minister, you repeatedly claim

00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.240
to be very close to this guilty official—

00:12:08.450 --> 00:12:10.510
how can you call it false accusation?

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:11.980
Moreover,

00:12:13.190 --> 00:12:15.600
if I hadn't considered your service
in two reigns

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.200
and sent someone
to investigate thoroughly,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:18.860
we might never have uncovered

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:22.190
your crime of regicide.

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:24.350
How dare he?

00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.270
Su Muyang!

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.240
You...

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:29.910
Bring in Jin Bao.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:31.340
Your Majesty!

00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.270
Your Majesty!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.470
Your Majesty!

00:12:35.610 --> 00:12:36.450
Your Majesty!

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:38.790
Spare my life, Your Majesty!

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.670
Prime Minister! Prime Minister!

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.150
Save me, Prime Minister!

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.440
Prime Minister, please save me!

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:48.910
You!

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:50.870
Fine!

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:54.070
Your Majesty!

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.200
It was Mr. Ji.

00:12:55.430 --> 00:12:58.000
Mr. Ji forced me to do it.

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.430
He had me secretly switch

00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.880
the late emperor's elixir.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.600
How dare he commit such a heinous act?

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.600
Mr. Ji wields immense power.

00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:09.270
I dared not disobey, Your Majesty.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.200
Have mercy, Your Majesty!

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.350
Immediately

00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:16.890
throw Ji Lan into the Imperial Prison.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.600
Execute the entire Ji family

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.090
to the utmost penalty.

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.030
They truly deserve it.

00:13:24.030 --> 00:13:25.080
Your Majesty!

00:13:25.390 --> 00:13:26.930
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.010
Your Majesty!

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:29.990
Please spare me, Your Majesty!

00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:31.120
Your Majesty!

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:34.760
[Li Residence]

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.840
Greetings, sir.

00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.550
Mr. Quan,

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.150
where are you rushing off to?

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:42.410
In a few days,

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:44.410
it will be the Master's birthday.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:45.540
I'm hurrying

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:46.440
to the wine shop

00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:48.070
to order some birthday wine.

00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:50.040
Such an important occasion—

00:13:50.080 --> 00:13:52.390
why haven't I heard anyone
in the residence mention it?

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:53.510
Our Master

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:55.720
has never liked extravagance.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.440
Even on his birthday every year,

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.560
he only has a simple meal.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.550
So I thought,

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.720
this year,

00:14:03.310 --> 00:14:04.550
with you, the Miss,

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:05.480
and the Young Master

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.150
all here,

00:14:07.330 --> 00:14:08.810
it's a rare gathering.

00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.240
We should make it lively,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:10.870
right?

00:14:10.990 --> 00:14:11.780
I'm off then.

00:14:47.130 --> 00:14:49.600
Your Majesty,
you're in quite a good mood today.

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.390
In the past, if you had

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.730
no business with me, you wouldn't take

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.690
a single step inside my palace.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.100
Now that I'm in this Imperial Prison,

00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:02.750
you actually enjoy coming.

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.200
Why did they

00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.890
give you such harsh treatment?

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:11.270
Drop your hypocritical act.

00:15:12.870 --> 00:15:15.580
Haven't you fawned and played

00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:17.680
the submissive role long enough?

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.130
Don't think I don't know.

00:15:21.390 --> 00:15:23.630
Once I, your only obstacle, am removed,

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:26.000
Li Shuang's coronation

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:27.920
will be just around the corner.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.270
Even at this point,

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000
all you care about

00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:36.580
is still the position of Empress.

00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.190
With such limited vision,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.000
how could you ever stand
on equal footing with me?

00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.630
From beginning to end,

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.610
you've always treated me
as if I didn't exist.

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:53.110
Besides the position of Empress,

00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.730
what else could I possibly care about?

00:15:58.610 --> 00:16:01.170
If I hadn't condescended
to marry you back then,

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:03.900
giving you access
to the Prime Minister's power,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.400
would you even be alive today?

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.510
Your arrogance

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:13.950
is exactly like your father's.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:17.510
Do you really think

00:16:19.270 --> 00:16:21.000
that I've survived until today

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.790
because I had the Ji family's support?

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:27.110
It was the late emperor
who didn't want me dead,

00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:28.720
because my life,

00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:30.450
just like our marriage,

00:16:30.890 --> 00:16:33.400
was just a pawn
to block misfortune for him.

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:36.720
I seized this empire with my own hands,

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:38.790
yet your Ji family

00:16:39.150 --> 00:16:40.840
wanted to reap the benefits.

00:16:41.630 --> 00:16:42.240
How could I

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:44.400
possibly forgive that?

00:17:06.030 --> 00:17:07.560
We are husband and wife.

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:12.420
Have you ever, for even a moment,

00:17:12.550 --> 00:17:14.829
treated me as your wife?

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:25.450
It's precisely because

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.609
you are my lawful wife

00:17:28.319 --> 00:17:29.610
that I cannot bear

00:17:30.030 --> 00:17:32.830
to see you executed publicly.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.170
Haven't you always coveted
the position of Empress?

00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:56.260
A posthumous title

00:17:57.630 --> 00:17:58.960
will serve just as well.

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:40.610
Father-in-law,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.160
you haven't eaten for days.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.110
I assume

00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.610
you've given up on life.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:47.890
You ungrateful bastard.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.510
So

00:18:50.070 --> 00:18:52.480
all this time
since you entered the capital,

00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:54.720
pretending weakness before me,

00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:59.410
it was just a staged performance

00:19:00.030 --> 00:19:02.440
to lure me into arranging Jin Bao,

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.510
trapping me in your

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:08.600
two-birds-one-stone scheme.

00:19:09.310 --> 00:19:11.110
That way, I could kill Father

00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:13.190
and get rid of you at the same time.

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:14.730
A temporary humiliation

00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.330
was nothing to me.

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:26.490
I won't die.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.270
Even if I must,

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:31.530
I will expose you first!

00:19:36.610 --> 00:19:38.370
Your right hand?

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.210
I do intend to kill you,

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:45.330
but I won't let you die so easily.

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.190
Do you really think

00:19:47.590 --> 00:19:48.920
that the entire court

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.060
doesn't know what really happened?

00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:04.190
Even so,

00:20:04.750 --> 00:20:05.720
today

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:07.470
I already hold absolute power

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.850
that cannot be shaken.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:14.320
Father-in-law, didn't you say

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:16.610
that I was incompetent
and had no achievements,

00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:18.140
unable to command respect?

00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.440
Your death

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:23.180
will be my first political accomplishment.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.680
Tianjiao!

00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.430
Su Muyang.

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.200
You will

00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:05.520
die a terrible death!

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.240
You want to execute me publicly

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.590
to establish your authority.

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.030
I absolutely won't let you

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.310
have your way!

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.340
Your Majesty,

00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:40.500
he has already died.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.660
Issue my edict:

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.680
the criminal official Ji Lan

00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.990
shall be beheaded,

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.650
and his head displayed at the city gate
for 3 days

00:21:51.650 --> 00:21:52.760
as a warning.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:53.720
Yes.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.000
Shuang.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:21:59.720
Father.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.790
I just received word

00:22:05.790 --> 00:22:07.320
that Ji Lan and his daughter

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.820
have died suddenly in prison.

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.410
Was it His Majesty?

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:16.750
When the rabbits all die,

00:22:16.750 --> 00:22:17.750
the hounds are no longer needed.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.410
Now that he sits on the throne,

00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.250
he won't allow anyone
to control him anymore.

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:25.210
I just didn't expect it all
to happen so quickly.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.830
You and Jin'an should pack immediately

00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:27.720
and depart at once.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.240
If you delay,

00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.370
who knows what could happen.

00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:29.960
Father.

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.940
With the Prime Minister's faction fallen,

00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.920
the Li family
will surely be the next target.

00:22:33.920 --> 00:22:35.440
How can I leave at a time like this

00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:37.240
and leave you to face this alone?

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:39.830
Didn't he tell you

00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:41.670
what I said to him?

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:45.920
Don't worry about me.

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.830
Leave immediately.

00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:48.270
The Li family's reputation

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:49.270
has been built over years

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:51.030
with blood and loyalty.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:53.410
Moreover, the Changfeng Army
is still under our command.

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:56.000
Even if His Majesty
wants to make things difficult for me,

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.510
I don't think he would go too far.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:22:59.550
But Father...

00:22:59.550 --> 00:23:02.880
His Majesty is here!

00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.200
Come here.

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:58.040
Back in Lucheng,

00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.790
I wanted to give you

00:23:59.790 --> 00:24:00.960
this hairpin,

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.400
but you refused it.

00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:03.590
Now,

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.550
it's finally in your hands again.

00:24:05.550 --> 00:24:06.750
Wear it

00:24:07.030 --> 00:24:09.160
when you attend the coronation, okay?

00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:25.560
The Prime Minister
was scheming his whole life,

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.880
yet in the end,

00:24:27.410 --> 00:24:29.440
his arrogance blinded him.

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:32.050
Unaware of the predator lurking behind,

00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.170
he died suddenly in the palace.

00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.480
I just didn't expect

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:39.060
that so soon after their deaths,

00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:42.810
you would already be arranging
the empress's coronation.

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.060
You truly are busy
with national affairs daily,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.920
without a moment's rest.

00:24:48.530 --> 00:24:49.930
Are you accusing me?

00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:53.390
Three years ago,

00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.430
if not for
the late emperor's arranged marriage,

00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:57.180
how could we have been separated?

00:24:57.180 --> 00:24:58.960
I only wish to make up for past regrets.

00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:00.200
Is that wrong?

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.510
I know

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:06.100
your heart belongs to Jin'an.

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:07.920
But I can grant him high office, wealth,

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:09.520
and a lifetime of prosperity

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.640
as compensation for him.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.490
Your Majesty, may I ask,

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.260
is this compensation really for Jin'an,

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.270
or for the unease

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.190
in your own heart?

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:28.970
Jin'an possesses divine power.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:30.960
How could he be easily abducted?

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.960
It was you

00:25:32.370 --> 00:25:34.700
who put Kongqing Water
in his wine that day

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:36.160
to suppress his power.

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:37.860
Prince Li died suddenly,

00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.540
and you claimed Jin'an did it.

00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:42.090
That's because you knew—

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.660
like a lamb entering the tiger's den—

00:25:43.660 --> 00:25:45.750
he wouldn't stand a chance
of returning alive.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:48.080
You shifted all the blame onto Jin'an.

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:50.130
Aren't you afraid that one day

00:25:51.510 --> 00:25:53.370
you'll face divine retribution?

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:04.710
Your right hand...

00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:09.690
That's right.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:12.710
I did it all.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.510
With this very right hand,

00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.950
I killed Su Muli.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:23.400
And it was I

00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.120
who tried to let Jin'an

00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:28.470
bear the guilt of fratricide for me,

00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:30.960
to die with scheming and injustice,

00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:33.170
with no place to be buried.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.080
Jin'an risked his life alone

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:37.370
for you.

00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:40.030
How could you repay him with betrayal?

00:26:40.030 --> 00:26:42.070
The victor takes all.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:43.700
That is the way of the world.

00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:46.050
To ascend to the throne,

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:47.200
I can sacrifice

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.510
parents, siblings,

00:26:48.790 --> 00:26:50.390
relatives, and even my wife.

00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.270
Yet I gave you

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.570
the only bit of true heart I had.

00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:59.750
And you want to betray me for another man.

00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.090
Even so,

00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.240
I forgave you.

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:07.790
I even allowed you
to go to Wuling Mountain to save him.

00:27:07.790 --> 00:27:09.120
I have repeatedly yielded

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:10.160
for your sake,

00:27:11.510 --> 00:27:13.370
showing the utmost benevolence.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.960
I am the Emperor.

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.360
Whatever I desire,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.110
I will obtain.

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:24.920
Whether you're willing or not,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.270
I will keep you by my side forever,

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:31.100
letting you, just like me,

00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:33.350
love without being loved in return,

00:27:33.350 --> 00:27:34.810
forever deprived of hope.

00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.480
All who defy me

00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:38.510
will meet a bitter end.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:18.640
Bro,

00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:20.170
do you think this man

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:21.430
could be Prince Annan?

00:28:21.530 --> 00:28:23.060
He does look quite like him.

00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.340
But seeing his carefree attitude,

00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:26.760
I'm not certain.

00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:28.780
That's impossible.

00:28:29.790 --> 00:28:30.720
That day, I clearly heard

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.070
what Bai Kun secretly reported

00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:33.240
to Empress Dowager Qin.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.570
There can be no mistake.

00:28:36.510 --> 00:28:37.360
Moreover,

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.200
Chen Kuan and his group

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:42.740
also disappeared
after arriving in Lucheng.

00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:43.670
And this man

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:45.160
came from Lucheng

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.110
with the female general
of the Changfeng Army.

00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:49.240
I don't think

00:28:50.070 --> 00:28:51.530
this is mere coincidence.

00:28:52.330 --> 00:28:53.460
Keep following him.

00:29:19.270 --> 00:29:20.790
You two have been following me all day.

00:29:20.790 --> 00:29:22.190
What exactly do you want?

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:23.920
Could it be that you plan to kill
and rob me

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.720
right under the Emperor's nose?

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.200
Sir, you misunderstand.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:30.990
We

00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:31.990
are not bandits.

00:29:32.010 --> 00:29:33.450
It's just that your appearance

00:29:33.450 --> 00:29:35.680
greatly resembles our long-missing master.

00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.310
That's why

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.000
we've rudely disturbed you.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:39.030
What's

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:40.950
your master's name?

00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.520
My master's surname is Duan.

00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:44.350
A year ago,

00:29:44.550 --> 00:29:45.900
he suffered great misfortune.

00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:47.970
Everyone said he was dead,

00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:49.400
but we two brothers know

00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.590
it wasn't

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.110
our master

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.750
in that coffin.

00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:55.030
Therefore, we have been

00:29:55.030 --> 00:29:56.720
searching for him tirelessly ever since.

00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.440
Right now,

00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:58.830
we've just arrived in Yunjing

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:00.760
and are unfamiliar with the place.

00:30:00.830 --> 00:30:01.830
We humbly ask you

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:02.890
for some guidance.

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:03.880
We

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.860
would be eternally grateful.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.640
I cannot help you find him.

00:30:19.430 --> 00:30:21.110
Judging by how weary and travel-worn
you are,

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:23.440
you must have suffered much along the way.

00:30:23.790 --> 00:30:25.240
Since your master is lost,

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.210
why not seek a new path for yourselves?

00:30:27.210 --> 00:30:29.200
A loyal servant serves only one master.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.410
We brothers

00:30:30.430 --> 00:30:31.830
have sworn a blood oath

00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:33.240
that even if we die,

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:35.530
we would follow him to the underworld,

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:37.880
loyal to him alone.

00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:42.880
It's been so long,

00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:45.040
and there's still no sign of him.

00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:46.410
Perhaps he's dead.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:48.640
I treat you politely only because

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:49.880
you resemble our master a bit.

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.300
If you dare speak nonsense again,

00:30:51.300 --> 00:30:52.190
I'll kill you!

00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:58.110
Wei Heng.

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:01.380
It's been a year,

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.920
and your temper hasn't changed.

00:31:11.170 --> 00:31:11.650
You...

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:16.530
I am Wang Meng.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.480
I am Wei Heng.

00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.240
Greetings, Prince Annan.

00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:19.970
Don't kneel.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.510
Are you saying

00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:35.050
that Empress Dowager Qin sent a letter

00:31:35.050 --> 00:31:37.170
and revealed my identity to Su Muyang?

00:31:37.170 --> 00:31:38.770
Meng and I rode here as fast as we could

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.180
just to reach you first.

00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.640
Otherwise,
once Empress Dowager Qin's message

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:43.160
reaches the Taijin Palace,

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.590
it would be difficult for you

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:45.310
to leave.

00:31:49.330 --> 00:31:51.000
I will definitely return to Yao State,

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.200
but not yet.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:54.830
Why?

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.960
During the Battle of Lucheng,

00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.490
Empress Dowager Qin
took Ze out of the palace.

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.720
I hurried there,

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160
and all I remember is a stone chamber

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:06.510
and that I did see Ze.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.350
But what happened afterward,

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.810
I've forgotten entirely.

00:32:11.830 --> 00:32:12.640
Ze...

00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:15.790
How did he die?

00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.030
I have failed you.

00:32:20.830 --> 00:32:21.640
That day,

00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.100
we followed you there,

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:24.460
but we arrived too late.

00:32:25.110 --> 00:32:26.310
When we arrived,

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.140
His Majesty

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:29.160
was already lying in a pool of blood.

00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.860
That day, Li Wei sheathed his sword
and tried to escape.

00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:32.250
We fought with all our might to stop him,

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.580
but he still got away.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:36.800
Prince Annan,

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:39.210
I heard that you had been

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:40.830
secretly staying close to his daughter,

00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:41.750
Li Shuang,

00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:44.030
and only recently entered the palace
with her.

00:32:44.030 --> 00:32:45.070
Is this

00:32:45.310 --> 00:32:46.720
a part of your plan?

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:50.480
I was in danger in Lucheng at that time.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:53.730
It was Li Shuang who saved me.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:56.090
It seems all of this

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.550
was arranged by fate.

00:32:58.830 --> 00:32:59.640
Li Wei.

00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:02.000
If Li Wei hadn't attempted
to assassinate His Majesty,

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.800
Empress Dowager Qin
wouldn't have come to power,

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:05.660
and Chen Kuan wouldn't have died.

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:07.190
Prince Annan,

00:33:07.210 --> 00:33:08.290
you must avenge

00:33:08.510 --> 00:33:09.790
His Majesty

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.320
and our fallen brothers.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:20.600
Prince Annan.

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.260
Li Shuang has nothing to do with this.

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.030
You must not harm her.

00:33:27.690 --> 00:33:29.420
The only one we are going to kill

00:33:30.270 --> 00:33:31.400
is Li Wei.

00:33:32.510 --> 00:33:33.240
Very well.

00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:35.120
As long as we can kill Li Wei,

00:33:35.310 --> 00:33:36.000
I

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:36.920
am willing to sacrifice everything

00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:38.240
to assist you loyally.

00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.880
I am Duan Aoze,

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:53.200
the sage ruler of Yao State.

00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.640
Who dares

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.000
to intrude?

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:02.160
I am Li Wei, General of Cavalry

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:03.590
of Taijin!

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:07.200
I'm here to end your miserable life!

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.520
Aodeng,

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.489
save me.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.480
Save me!

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:21.199
Your Majesty!

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:28.510
I am your elder brother!

00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:32.659
When we arrived,

00:34:32.679 --> 00:34:33.520
His Majesty

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.139
was already lying in a pool of blood.

00:34:35.139 --> 00:34:36.900
That day, Li Wei sheathed his sword
and tried to escape.

00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:38.400
We fought with all our might to stop him,

00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:39.840
but he still got away.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.190
It's so late.

00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:54.200
Why haven't you gone to bed?

00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.520
I was waiting for you.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:01.200
Where have you been?

00:36:02.190 --> 00:36:03.280
I had nothing to do,

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:04.820
so I went for a walk.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.630
Father said

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.230
you had something to tell me.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:27.360
No wonder people say

00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.010
a man is a different person

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:29.940
before

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.920
and after marriage.

00:36:32.410 --> 00:36:34.670
You used to be completely honest with me,

00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:36.680
and now you have your own secrets.

00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.750
You don't have hidden savings, do you?

00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:44.510
Don't worry.

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:46.400
I couldn't care less.

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.360
That won't do.

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:52.670
You're the only one in this world

00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:54.000
who can keep me in check.

00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.950
I've asked the Grand General
for your hand,

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:04.760
and he agreed.

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:11.110
I'm planning to take you away
from Yunjing.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:18.070
Then we can cut ties

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.710
with all our troubles

00:37:20.110 --> 00:37:21.280
and start fresh,

00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:24.110
living the life we want.

00:37:30.210 --> 00:37:31.340
You don't want that?

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.910
How could I not?

00:37:35.580 --> 00:37:36.920
Being with you forever

00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:39.830
is all I've ever wanted.

00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.400
Tomorrow

00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.640
is the Grand General's birthday.

00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.890
Once we leave,

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:53.480
who knows when we'll see him again.

00:37:53.590 --> 00:37:54.630
How about we stay

00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:57.180
to celebrate his birthday before leaving?

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.400
Your Majesty,

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.660
there's an urgent letter from Yao State.

00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:35.760
The land cession hasn't been settled yet.

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:38.360
What trick are they trying to play
this time?

00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:40.550
Put it here.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:51.430
Your Majesty,

00:38:51.670 --> 00:38:54.440
the birthday gift
you ordered for General Li

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:55.630
has been delivered.

00:38:59.830 --> 00:39:02.150
General Li's military achievements
are remarkable.

00:39:02.150 --> 00:39:03.320
And General Li Shuang

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:04.760
has also won great military merit

00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:06.550
and will soon enter the palace
to serve at your side.

00:39:06.550 --> 00:39:07.360
Your Majesty,

00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:08.960
if you value the Li family,

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.190
why don't you visit personally

00:39:10.190 --> 00:39:11.920
to show your imperial favor?

00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:13.550
Are you saying

00:39:15.110 --> 00:39:16.880
the Li family's achievements

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:18.440
are unmatched,

00:39:19.510 --> 00:39:20.630
and even I

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:23.160
must curry favor with them?

00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.030
I dare not.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:26.500
I spoke out of turn.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.400
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:28.920
Get out!

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:29.670
Yes.

00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:51.630
Recently, I was surprised to learn

00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:52.920
that the death of Prince Annan,

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:55.850
Duan Aodeng,
under the former ruler was suspicious.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:57.510
After thorough investigation,

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.970
we discovered that he is now
hiding in Taijin

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:01.570
under the name Jin'an.

00:40:01.950 --> 00:40:03.270
The Emperor of Taijin,

00:40:03.290 --> 00:40:04.560
please do us a favor

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:06.330
and spare him any trouble.

00:40:08.840 --> 00:40:10.550
Jin'an is actually Duan Aodeng?
