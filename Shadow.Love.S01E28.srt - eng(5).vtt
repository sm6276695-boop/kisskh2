00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 28]

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:46.280
I'm late.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.920
I'm sorry.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.759
Knowing you're safe

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.360
puts my mind at ease.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.910
When did you get here?

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.690
Did I lose control again?

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.010
Did I hurt you?

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.500
No.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.079
Really, you didn't.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.190
You can't stay here.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.510
Why not?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.360
You just can't stay here.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.280
Once the Jade Linglong is removed,
I'll forget you anyway.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.430
Maybe it's better

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.440
to put an end to everything now.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.510
Then have you considered

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.310
whether I can forget you,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.220
whether I can let go
of everything about you?

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.680
You must let go no matter what.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.960
Then why did you carve these murals?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.510
You still can't forget me.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.020
I said you can't stay here!

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:23.620
What if I lose control and hurt you again?

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.390
What if I kill you?

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:51.760
Engrave this pain in your mind.

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.910
Even though our blood pact

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.170
will disappear
after the Jade Linglong is removed,

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.910
this mark

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.120
will remain on your body forever.

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:08.840
This is our new bond.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:14.870
Jin'an,

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.390
if we're really

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:20.720
running out of time,

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:24.120
it's exactly why
we should cherish every minute.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.010
I once told you

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.070
that no matter what befalls us,

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.510
I will always stay by your side.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.570
You'll be

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.800
my one

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:46.000
and only love for my entire life.

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:31.240
Witnessed by heaven and earth,

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:32.630
I, Li Shuang,

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:34.770
will marry Jin'an

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:36.950
till death do us part,

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:38.540
with unwavering faith.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:43.720
Witnessed by heaven and earth,

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.680
I, Jin'an,

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.040
will marry Li Shuang

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:49.180
with unison of spirit and will

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.320
and never fail her.

Senior, let me help you.

00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.450
M-Miss Lu.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:55.000
What you learned down the mountain

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.240
probably won't

00:10:56.260 --> 00:10:57.620
be of much help here.

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:58.440
So

00:10:58.720 --> 00:10:59.780
don't mess around.

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:00.890
I...

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:01.560
Senior.

00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:09.150
Miss,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:10.130
come with me.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.390
He's

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:14.600
blunt

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.850
and terrible with words.

00:11:15.850 --> 00:11:16.610
Miss,

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:18.270
please don't take it personally.

00:11:18.270 --> 00:11:19.270
However,

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:20.960
since you're pregnant now,

00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:23.020
you really shouldn't overexert yourself.

00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:24.020
Besides,

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:25.980
the abundant medicinal herbs here

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.920
aren't good for your baby.

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.760
We don't want to cause trouble

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.170
for the Master.

00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.550
Stop talking nonsense!

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:36.270
What?

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:37.570
Come with me.

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:42.690
Watch out. My belly.

00:11:43.890 --> 00:11:45.700
How many people have you told this to?

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:47.660
You're ruining my reputation.

00:11:49.450 --> 00:11:51.480
When I first arrived at the mountain,

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.280
I said it once at the entrance.

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:55.760
Who knew it would be so widely spread?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.430
I really didn't expect

00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:58.950
that people at Wuling Mountain

00:11:58.950 --> 00:11:59.590
would be

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:01.220
even worse gossips than I am.

00:12:02.430 --> 00:12:03.960
You can't blame it all on me.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:42.240
You're awake.

00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:45.380
What are you doing?

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:47.990
I'm making breakfast for you.

00:12:47.990 --> 00:12:49.390
Making breakfast for me?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.910
I've noticed

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.300
that among ordinary married couples,

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.260
wives always get up early

00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:57.870
to prepare food for their husbands.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.480
I'm not really good at cooking.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.510
So I'm just

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.650
following their example to give it a try.

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:10.480
Who says women must cook

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.940
and serve their husbands?

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:13.630
As busy as you are,

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.360
you can totally

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.870
leave these chores to me.

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.250
Am I dreaming?

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:32.050
It couldn't be more real.

00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:43.660
The Wuling Mountain

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.280
is tranquil and peaceful

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.050
with picturesque scenery.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:48.930
It'd be nice if we could

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.890
settle down here.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.750
No need to rush into a decision now.

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.840
We

00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:00.860
can wander around first.

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:01.750
And then,

00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:04.320
once the Jade Linglong is taken out,

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.720
we can leave everything behind.

00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:08.060
And

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.330
in this vast world,

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.730
we'll surely find
our own secluded paradise.

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.000
I know

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.120
you have the Li family

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.750
and the Changfeng Army to take care of.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:23.550
So

00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.650
you can't shrug off

00:14:26.170 --> 00:14:28.570
these responsibilities and leave easily.

00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:30.790
If you want,

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.550
we can go back to Lucheng.

00:14:33.830 --> 00:14:36.090
Lucheng holds many of our memories, too.

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:39.270
Back to Lucheng.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:41.560
Be it

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:42.920
a secluded paradise

00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:44.510
or

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:46.380
a bustling ordinary place,

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:49.410
wherever you are

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:51.740
is where I belong.

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:07.890
I'm dying of thirst.

00:15:11.710 --> 00:15:14.190
You were sneaking around
outside the clinic earlier.

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:15.650
What exactly are you up to?

00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.770
Jin'an already has Shuang
looking after him,

00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:23.050
and my mission here is complete.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:24.860
I'm a physician.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:26.820
At this revered place of medicine,

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.840
of course I hope

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.900
to learn more skills before I return.

00:15:32.870 --> 00:15:34.940
Then I advise you not to waste your time.

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:36.910
The secret medical methods
of our Wuling Mountain are

00:15:36.910 --> 00:15:38.570
never shared with outsiders.

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.360
Why?

00:15:40.510 --> 00:15:42.940
All physicians in the world are
like one family.

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.090
If I master your skills,

00:15:44.090 --> 00:15:46.170
I can help more people down the mountain

00:15:46.170 --> 00:15:48.800
and continue being
Lucheng's No.1 Physician.

00:15:52.330 --> 00:15:53.910
At worst, I'll put up with it,

00:15:53.910 --> 00:15:54.780
kneel before you,

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:55.790
kowtow three times,

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.050
and call you my master.

00:15:59.020 --> 00:16:00.420
Are you thirsty, Master?

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:02.190
Have some water.

00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.920
What do you think this place is?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:04.550
A martial arts school

00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:05.480
or a pharmacy?

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:08.710
At Wuling Mountain, we have
strict conditions for accepting disciples.

00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:09.360
Either

00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.910
you're destined to be here,

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.430
or

00:16:18.450 --> 00:16:21.110
you must exchange
what you treasure most for it.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:22.460
Only by letting go of everything

00:16:22.460 --> 00:16:24.360
can you focus on training
with a clear mind.

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:26.240
What I treasure most?

00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:29.200
I can't give it away.

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:33.190
No way.

00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:47.800
Fine.

00:16:52.710 --> 00:16:53.920
Take it.

00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.410
You're returning to me

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.770
the thing I gave you?

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.060
You should consider changing your career.

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:05.380
No one's as scheming

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:06.440
as you are.

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:09.440
I just told you I couldn't give it away.

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:09.960
But

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.000
this is indeed what I treasure most.

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:15.920
You've said it yourself

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.960
that ordinary people love fortune.

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:18.790
In our place,

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:20.589
you can't get far without money.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.920
Here, take it.

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:28.840
Seeing money as treasure

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.230
is utterly shallow.

00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:31.820
In my opinion,

00:17:31.850 --> 00:17:34.980
you're completely incompatible
with Wuling Mountain.

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.510
Watch out!

00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:14.440
Are you alright?

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.550
Help them!

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:17.240
Hurry!

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.190
Put out the fire!

00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:20.610
Stay here.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:23.830
No, I won't.

00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.080
I'll go with you!

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.730
Quickly,

00:18:27.070 --> 00:18:27.550
take them to the clinic.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:28.070
Hurry!

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.000
Hang in there.

00:18:29.190 --> 00:18:30.920
Let's treat the injured first.

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:32.440
Get up slowly.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.480
Help me up.

00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:36.920
Master!

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.750
It's all my fault.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.790
I put two batches
of incompatible medicinal pills

00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:41.960
into the furnace at the same time.

00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.110
Let's talk about it later.

00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:44.570
Saving lives comes first.

00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:53.510
Watch out!

00:19:08.850 --> 00:19:10.580
The acupoint-sealing needle?

00:19:11.550 --> 00:19:12.070
Oh, no!

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.550
Hurry!

00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.120
It was a diversion.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:15.890
Lu Xin,

00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:17.810
help me look after the injured.

00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:21.070
Be careful!

00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.470
What a lovey-dovey couple you two make.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.120
I'm almost moved to tears.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:03.070
Master,

00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:04.510
you can leave them

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.350
to us.

00:20:08.530 --> 00:20:10.930
For those who trespass on Wuling Mountain,

00:20:11.020 --> 00:20:12.660
show no mercy.

00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:14.940
Stop him!

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.080
Kill them!

00:20:25.570 --> 00:20:27.770
When love is at its peak,

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000
it's nothing more than a wish
to live and die together.

00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:36.480
As a shadow puppet,
you really keep surprising me.

00:20:39.530 --> 00:20:41.450
When you serve your next master,

00:20:41.910 --> 00:20:44.070
you will surely reach perfection.

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:48.040
If you were really capable
of dealing with me,

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.160
why would you risk your life

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:52.510
coming all the way to Wuling Mountain
to seek death?

00:20:52.510 --> 00:20:53.660
I'm seeking death?

00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.480
You've already drunk the Kongqing Water.

00:20:59.870 --> 00:21:02.420
How could you possibly kill me now?

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:04.340
You've harmed so many people.

00:21:04.850 --> 00:21:05.680
Today

00:21:06.170 --> 00:21:07.630
you'll pay with your life!

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:16.180
Jin'an!

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:37.240
Jin'an!

00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:40.180
You had a narrow escape last time.

00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.380
How dare you set foot
on Wuling Mountain again?

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.970
My dear sworn brother,

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:48.200
since you know how much effort
I've put into this shadow puppet,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.440
you really shouldn't have been
so soft-hearted to let him survive.

00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440
Otherwise,

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.880
I wouldn't get what I want.

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.000
You killed your father,
betrayed your master,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.880
and harmed the innocent.

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:00.610
Your crimes are unforgivable!

00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:02.610
As the Master of Wuling Mountain,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:03.480
today

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.060
I will purge the traitor!

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.530
Brain-Devouring Powder?

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:30.130
How did you get poisoned by this?

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:31.410
Shut up!

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.240
If you hadn't

00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:38.440
kicked me out like scum back then,

00:22:39.690 --> 00:22:42.860
how would I have ended up like this?

00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:48.270
I'll kill everyone on Wuling Mountain!

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.760
An eye for an eye!

00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:05.550
Jin'an!

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.790
Shuang.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.400
Impossible.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:06.370
How could the Jade Linglong...

00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:07.910
Surprised?

00:24:09.210 --> 00:24:12.410
Jade Linglong,
the sacred relic you've been protecting,

00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:15.000
is an evil artifact in and of itself!

00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.950
I practice forbidden techniques.

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.470
Only I

00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:26.100
can successfully extract
the Jade Linglong!

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.270
This is what you get

00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:31.240
for treating me unfairly!

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:40.620
Are you alright?

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.030
Good!

00:24:47.370 --> 00:24:48.770
Then I'll kill you all...

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.440
I'll kill everyone who has wronged me!

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:56.960
Lu Xin!

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:58.150
Qianji Needle!

00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:16.310
How are you feeling?

00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:24.740
Shuang.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:03.700
I'll help you suppress the poison first.

00:26:06.050 --> 00:26:08.920
It's too late.

00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:18.470
K-Kill me.

00:27:28.590 --> 00:27:29.440
Godfather,

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.930
I have retrieved the Jade Linglong

00:27:33.460 --> 00:27:35.190
and avenged your death at last.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.370
Since it brought you pain to let go,

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.080
why didn't you give him a proper burial?

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.400
At least you'd have a place
to remember him.

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:55.310
It's been the custom of Wuling Mountain

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:57.270
since ancient times.

00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:01.680
That's the freedom

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:03.820
people should enjoy.

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.310
My godfather was buried

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:08.670
because his death was suspicious,

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.000
with justice unserved.

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.370
Now that I've avenged
my godfather's death,

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:15.230
I should let him return to nature,

00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:16.880
free from all constraints.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:24.000
Jin Wujian and I

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:25.730
may have been sworn brothers,

00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:27.720
but he committed too many evil deeds.

00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:29.880
He got what he deserved.

00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:32.560
Don't let yourself
sink too deep into sorrow.

00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:35.020
I'm not like you all,

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:37.590
people of the martial world

00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.310
who punish the wicked

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:41.350
and see killing as no big deal.

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:43.160
In my eyes,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:44.930
even the evilest person

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:48.070
is still a life.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:51.070
Then why did you

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:52.880
still take action?

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.360
You said the other day

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.810
that to be a disciple of Wuling Mountain,

00:28:58.810 --> 00:29:01.200
one must give up what they cherish most.

00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:03.520
My parents died.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.680
My clinic burned down.

00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.240
And even Nanxing is gone.

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.680
I'm all alone.

00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:15.350
I thought I had nothing left to lose.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:19.510
That moment

00:29:20.350 --> 00:29:21.960
when I saw your lives in danger,

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.240
hanging by a thread,

00:29:23.460 --> 00:29:24.790
I finally realized

00:29:24.810 --> 00:29:27.240
that what I cherish most are my friends.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:29.720
Even if it costs me my life,

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.950
I absolutely cannot lose them.

00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:06.530
Jin'an.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:08.400
Jin'an!

00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:11.590
I'm here.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.790
I'm here.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.100
You were ready

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.580
to risk your life for me again?

00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:36.430
We're alive.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.310
From today on,

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:44.180
nothing will ever separate us again.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:04.400
What happened recently

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.720
feels like

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:08.480
a long, bizarre dream.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:11.480
But thankfully,

00:31:12.790 --> 00:31:13.790
the dream is over,

00:31:15.070 --> 00:31:16.600
and you're still by my side.

00:31:18.790 --> 00:31:20.320
Without the Jade Linglong,

00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:21.990
I've lost all my power

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:24.680
and can no longer protect you like before.

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:27.520
Will you be disappointed in me?

00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:32.200
As a great general,

00:31:32.550 --> 00:31:34.790
why would I need
someone else's protection?

00:31:34.790 --> 00:31:36.400
When I first fell for you,

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.640
you were the fragile one.

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:48.480
Since you, my dear wife, are so mighty,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.700
I'll stick with you

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:51.880
for protection from now on.

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.100
When we return to Lucheng,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:57.480
we'll

00:31:58.190 --> 00:31:59.220
build a house

00:32:00.550 --> 00:32:01.680
and clear some land.

00:32:02.410 --> 00:32:03.330
You'll farm,

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:05.720
hunt,

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:07.030
fetch water,

00:32:07.990 --> 00:32:09.190
and water the garden.

00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.780
Dream on!

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.480
If I do all the work,

00:32:16.480 --> 00:32:17.480
what about you?

00:32:18.060 --> 00:32:19.540
I'll cook, of course.

00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.030
Otherwise, your "outstanding" cooking

00:32:22.030 --> 00:32:23.880
will make us starve to death.

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.840
Are you making fun of me?

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:27.750
You're taking advantage
of my lack of strength.

00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:29.070
You're teasing me!

00:33:18.610 --> 00:33:19.280
Hold on.

00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.950
That day, a hairpin fell from me.

00:33:27.550 --> 00:33:28.400
I have no idea

00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.070
when I had it on me.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.950
But you know,

00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.130
this Wuling Mountain

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.790
is awash with rare treasures.

00:33:35.250 --> 00:33:36.830
I probably thought it was pretty

00:33:36.830 --> 00:33:37.940
and decided

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.880
to keep it for you.

00:33:42.890 --> 00:33:43.950
Let me put it on you.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000
Don't take it off.

00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:06.660
This is the first time
I've given someone a gift.

00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:08.060
Thanks for indulging me.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:18.949
Is this hairpin a bit plain?

00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:22.159
It's fine.

00:34:22.239 --> 00:34:23.500
You make it beautiful.

00:34:32.929 --> 00:34:34.040
Have I

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.260
forgotten something?

00:34:38.570 --> 00:34:39.420
No.

00:34:41.110 --> 00:34:43.030
I also think it's a bit plain,

00:34:43.429 --> 00:34:44.630
but I love it.

00:35:02.070 --> 00:35:03.240
Mo Yin said

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:05.040
that after the Jade Linglong was removed,

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.480
Jin'an's supernatural strength

00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:07.670
disappeared.

00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:09.320
His body

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.800
will return to normal.

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.730
But he will gradually forget
his previous memories.

00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:17.210
I'm most worried about you now.

00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:20.280
Though you're reunited,

00:35:21.110 --> 00:35:22.840
Jin'an will forget

00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.920
everything about you.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840
Sometimes I think

00:35:28.830 --> 00:35:31.030
forgetting isn't necessarily a bad thing.

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.800
At least

00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:33.840
before he completely forgets me,

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:36.790
we still have moments
of happiness and peace.

00:35:39.030 --> 00:35:41.150
You two are leaving everything behind.

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:42.900
Did Su Muyang say anything about this?

00:35:42.900 --> 00:35:44.760
Will he make things difficult for you?

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:45.510
What if

00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:48.540
he holds the Li family hostage

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.710
and makes some outrageous demands?

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:52.360
What will you do then?

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:58.140
Wait a minute.

00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:00.230
As adamant as he was,

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:02.710
why would he easily let you
come to Wuling Mountain?

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:04.910
Did you already promise him something?

00:36:11.590 --> 00:36:12.670
Are you crazy?

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.060
Are you going to give up on your life
just like this?

00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:17.120
It's worth it.

00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:20.800
If you do this,

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:22.710
Jin'an will be hurt the most.

00:36:23.110 --> 00:36:24.630
From what I know of him,

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.980
he would rather die a thousand times

00:36:27.150 --> 00:36:29.010
than let you sacrifice yourself.

00:36:34.550 --> 00:36:35.960
I've thought it over.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.960
After we return,

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:39.760
I'll find a place

00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:41.550
to settle him down.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:43.960
Once we're back in Yunjing,

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:45.920
he'll probably

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.060
forget about me soon

00:36:49.110 --> 00:36:51.030
and start a new life.

00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:54.920
The time he spent with me

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.000
was filled with suffering.

00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:58.360
I want him

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.180
to lead a happy life in the future.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:29.130
Where have you been?

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:31.300
Let me show you something.

00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:34.960
I found this on the mountain.

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:37.320
When I saw it the other day,

00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:38.800
it was almost withered.

00:37:39.310 --> 00:37:40.790
So I watered it.

00:37:41.800 --> 00:37:42.660
Surprisingly,

00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:44.960
it revived

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280
and even bloomed!

00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:53.670
I want

00:37:53.880 --> 00:37:55.400
to plant it in the courtyard

00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:57.690
as a symbol of our new beginning here.

00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:08.840
I know

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:11.720
that without the Jade Linglong,

00:38:12.630 --> 00:38:14.630
I'll gradually forget many things.

00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:18.030
But

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:20.850
we still have plenty of time

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.710
to create new memories together.

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:26.770
Just like this flower.

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:29.590
It withered

00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:31.760
but also found a new life.

00:38:33.710 --> 00:38:36.040
But we're about to leave Wuling Mountain.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.400
No one

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:39.470
can attend to these flowers then.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:42.080
Then let's take it back to Lucheng.

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:44.460
And every time we do something together,

00:38:44.950 --> 00:38:46.310
we'll plant a new flower

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.250
until the hills and fields

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.730
abound with them and our memories.

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:52.630
How's it?

00:38:55.230 --> 00:38:55.840
Okay.

00:39:04.670 --> 00:39:05.590
What's wrong?

00:39:09.670 --> 00:39:10.920
I just feel

00:39:11.630 --> 00:39:13.230
that we've been through a lot

00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:14.710
along our journey.

00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:17.310
I only want to cherish the present.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:19.850
Let's live every single day

00:39:20.230 --> 00:39:21.690
left for us to the fullest.

00:39:32.050 --> 00:39:32.690
Okay.
