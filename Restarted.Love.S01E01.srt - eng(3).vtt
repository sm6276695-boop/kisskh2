00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.760
Xu Xin

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:52.319
Xu Xin

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:18.319
Lu Ming

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.000
What's wrong?

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:21.639
There's a child downstairs at our place.

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:22.520
A child?

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:34.039
Where did you see him?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.520
He was just here.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.199
The door opened.

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:51.400
The door was locked.

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.000
What did you see?

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.319
A butterfly.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.639
Miss Xu.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.319
Based on your current condition,

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.160
I have enough reason to believe

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.879
you are experiencing memory distortion.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.079
The car accident caused your brain

00:04:53.079 --> 00:04:54.279
to suffer serious damage.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.120
It has already affected your daily life.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.319
Like the little boy you just mentioned,

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:04.720
he may not actually exist.

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.439
But my feelings are very real.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.839
I really did see a little boy.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.079
Did you find any signs of someone breaking into your home?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:22.959
Dr. Xu,

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:26.560
is there a way for my memory to recover quickly?

00:05:26.839 --> 00:05:28.040
Everyone hopes for that.

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.199
But the brain

00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:31.480
is an extremely complex organ.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.759
It can't simply rely on medication

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.480
to recover immediately.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.199
And you don't need to worry.

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:39.480
Your condition is not rare.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.560
There are many cases of recovery.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.839
So, have confidence in my expertise.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.120
And have confidence in yourself.

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.480
Let's work together.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.439
Alright?

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:56.000
Dr. Xu, your next patient is here.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:56.639
Okay.

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:58.600
Miss Xu,

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.800
if you have any new developments,

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.600
you can come to me anytime.

00:06:03.079 --> 00:06:04.199
Thank you, Dr. Xu.

00:06:16.399 --> 00:06:17.279
How have you been lately?

00:06:17.759 --> 00:06:18.959
Come on, let's sit over here.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.199
I'll take you home first in a bit.

00:06:26.519 --> 00:06:27.560
I have an interview afterwards.

00:06:44.519 --> 00:06:45.279
Unfortunately,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.079
at the opening ceremony,

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:49.120
my wife was by my side.

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.759
But there was an accident.

00:06:51.319 --> 00:06:52.360
She was injured.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.639
She is still recovering.

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.639
I will put aside all my work for now

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.959
to spend time with her.

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:03.040
Has the investigation into the accident concluded?

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:05.480
The driver was fatigued.

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.040
He paid for it with his life.

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.519
I hope tragedies like this

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.480
never happen again.

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.480
Let's talk about your new work.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.639
This one is called City of Lies.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.839
Are you trying to say that in your life

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.439
there are many lies?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.720
People say marriage is like a fortress.

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:36.680
But I think it's like a visual music box.

00:07:37.839 --> 00:07:39.199
Only those inside

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.360
can truly feel it.

00:07:42.519 --> 00:07:44.360
A music box is a child's toy.

00:07:44.759 --> 00:07:47.160
Using it as a metaphor for marriage

00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.680
isn't it too childish?

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.759
No matter how you interpret it,

00:07:55.759 --> 00:07:56.920
at least for me,

00:07:58.439 --> 00:07:59.839
marriage is not a game.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.680
My wife loves me very much.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:14.759
And I love my wife very much.

00:08:25.959 --> 00:08:27.519
Ms. Xu, your flowers.

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:42.320
Are you feeling any better?

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:44.720
Pretty good.

00:08:46.759 --> 00:08:47.799
Have you remembered anything?

00:08:50.519 --> 00:08:52.039
Just bits and pieces.

00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.120
Dr. Xu said

00:09:00.039 --> 00:09:00.960
not to rush.

00:09:01.799 --> 00:09:04.240
This illness needs time to heal.

00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:13.639
By the way, thanks for the flowers.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:16.679
What?

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:19.279
They're beautiful.

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.600
I didn't send you any flowers.

00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:34.639
Maybe a friend sent them.

00:11:06.559 --> 00:11:08.039
You want to buy this novel too?

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:10.159
This seems to be the last copy.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:11.960
If you want it, you can have it.

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.240
No need, you take it.

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:15.919
If I’m not mistaken,

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.360
you were just a bit faster than me.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.120
You touched the book first.

00:11:19.399 --> 00:11:20.039
Really?

00:11:21.559 --> 00:11:23.320
Actually, I already have a copy at home.

00:11:23.679 --> 00:11:25.720
I just wanted another one for my collection.

00:11:28.159 --> 00:11:29.399
Then I won’t be polite.

00:11:31.039 --> 00:11:32.759
By the way, could you do me a favor?

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.759
Three, two, one.

00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.000
I think this one looks good. Take a look.

00:11:42.159 --> 00:11:43.440
I think it’s great.

00:11:43.679 --> 00:11:44.399
Thank you.

00:11:44.559 --> 00:11:45.399
You’re welcome.

00:11:52.799 --> 00:11:53.840
Hold on to it.

00:11:54.039 --> 00:11:54.759
Thanks.

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.840
Hope to see you here again next time.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:12:00.039
Me too.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.240
Bye.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.000
Boss.

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:07.600
Was that really

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.159
the last copy of The Klein Bottle just now?

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:10.759
That was the only one.

00:12:12.559 --> 00:12:13.200
Alright.

00:12:14.799 --> 00:12:15.399
Miss,

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.279
could you come by again tomorrow?

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:20.360
I’ll get one from the warehouse for you.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.639
Is that too much trouble?

00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:23.759
Not at all.

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:26.320
Not many people buy physical books these days.

00:12:26.559 --> 00:12:31.279
You have to be accommodating if you want good business.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:33.879
Thank you, boss.

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:11.799
Xu Xin, what's wrong?

00:16:12.879 --> 00:16:15.480
There's something in the washing machine.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:21.680
Get some rest early.

00:20:11.839 --> 00:20:12.480
Hello.

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:15.240
Excuse me, the book I ordered yesterday—

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.440
Has The Klein Bottle arrived?

00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:18.119
What are you talking about?

00:20:19.599 --> 00:20:21.599
I ordered a book here yesterday.

00:20:21.599 --> 00:20:22.519
It's called The Klein Bottle.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.640
Hold on a moment.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.559
Which book?

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400
The Klein Bottle.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:33.200
The Klein Bottle.

00:20:35.319 --> 00:20:35.880
No.

00:20:36.359 --> 00:20:37.599
Our store has never stocked that book.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.680
Please come back tomorrow.

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:41.680
I'll get a copy from the warehouse for you.

00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:45.400
But yesterday your manager said—

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:47.440
He would get one for me.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.279
The manager doesn't work regular shifts.

00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:52.880
I've been the only one on duty since the day before yesterday.

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.559
Last night at eight o'clock—

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.279
When I came in—

00:21:01.359 --> 00:21:02.359
There was only one copy left in your store—

00:21:02.359 --> 00:21:03.559
Just one copy of The Klein Bottle.

00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.440
But then another girl bought it.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.799
At that time, your manager promised—

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:11.359
To get another copy for me.

00:21:11.759 --> 00:21:12.799
And told me to pick it up today.

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.119
You must be mistaken.

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:16.160
From yesterday until now—

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.000
I've definitely been the only one working.

00:21:18.759 --> 00:21:19.319
Besides—

00:21:19.759 --> 00:21:21.039
You're so pretty—

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.400
If you'd been here—

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:23.519
I would definitely remember you.

00:21:26.519 --> 00:21:27.880
Come, take a look yourself.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.279
We have cameras in every corner of the store.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:33.079
Look here.

00:21:34.599 --> 00:21:35.720
Eight o'clock, right?

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.160
Here, that's me at the counter.

00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.920
Where are you?

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.160
From eight to ten—

00:21:41.519 --> 00:21:43.799
I'll fast-forward, you can see for yourself.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.480
Can I guess the ending faster than the characters in the book?

00:21:56.599 --> 00:21:57.839
Can I figure out the ending sooner?

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.599
Hope to see you here again next time.

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.960
Miss Xu.

00:22:29.599 --> 00:22:30.960
I'm a psychiatrist.

00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.680
And also a materialist.

00:22:33.359 --> 00:22:34.839
I don't believe that in this world—

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.599
Such things could exist.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:38.759
Dr. Xu.

00:22:39.839 --> 00:22:41.519
You still don't believe what I say, do you?

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:43.200
Based on your description—

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:47.559
I think your memory distortion is getting worse.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.920
Clothes in the washing machine can't just disappear.

00:22:51.319 --> 00:22:54.160
And the leaked water wouldn't dry up instantly.

00:22:54.559 --> 00:22:57.960
If everything you see, hear, and remember—

00:22:58.079 --> 00:23:00.160
Can't be explained by common sense—

00:23:00.279 --> 00:23:01.480
Then the only possibility—

00:23:01.799 --> 00:23:03.720
Is that your brain is deceiving you.

00:23:04.119 --> 00:23:05.440
So, Miss Xu—

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:07.839
Don't trust what you see.

00:23:42.039 --> 00:23:43.559
There's a kid downstairs in our building.

00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.680
Where did you see them?
