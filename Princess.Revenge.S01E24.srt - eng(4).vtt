Do you know about diamond burials?

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:47.560
After cremation, 2% carbon remains

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.679
in human ashes,

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.479
which can be refined into diamonds.

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:59.840
It's true that I'm with Yunzhou.

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.200
And this is Yunzhou.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.799
(I'm the female lead in this novel.)

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.120
(Why is my story)

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.239
(all garbled now?)

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:25.200
Yunzhou!

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:27.560
I'm so scared.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.519
I think this world is all fake.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.079
But my love for you is true.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.079
Since you love me so deeply,

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:45.760
could you do me this one last favor?

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.799
Sure.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:48.840
I'll do anything for you.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.000
Ye Yunzhou was the beloved

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.319
you were with all this time.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:38.319
How could you kill him?

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.520
He was nothing but mere words.

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.240
I'm the female lead in the novel.

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.879
Career.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.919
Wealth.

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:50.199
They all should be mine.

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:52.199
He had himself to blame

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:54.560
for not dying as set by the plot.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.360
That was why the novel got destroyed.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.319
I'm going to restart the plot.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.319
I want everyone

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.159
to be good and get back on track!

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.360
Dongfang Xi.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.159
You should feel lucky

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.759
that you've had
the Dongfangs' protection.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:18.840
It took me ten years

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.159
just to approach you.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.000
Bai Zhitao.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.400
Open your eyes
and look around this world.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.080
This is the real world,

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.199
not the novel.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.840
What do you mean?

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:35.759
If this were the real world,

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.159
would Dongfang Yan have just vanished
for no reason over the past ten years?

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.680
I'll destroy the only thought
of Dongfang Yan

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.280
that you've been holding on to

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:51.479
completely.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.039
Just like how you ruined my plot.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:03:59.400
Stop it!

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:03.759
Though you're Dongfang Group's

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:05.240
heiress...

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:07.000
Oh, no.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.800
You're its CEO now.

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.080
This building

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.159
belongs to me now.

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.480
I'm the chairman here.

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:21.079
If you don't want to get fired,

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.319
do as I say.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.160
Take everything away.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.360
I'm from the Dongfang family.

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:28.879
Are you sure

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:30.680
you want to side with her?

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.720
Supporting characters

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:34.920
only exist to help the leads.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.759
Nothing else matters.

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:38.879
In your story,

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:39.680
they're not the leads.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.160
But they're the leads

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.720
in their own stories.

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:47.079
Well,

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.480
these people

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.680
are just referred to as "them"

00:04:52.079 --> 00:04:53.040
in the novel.

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.160
And you

00:04:55.519 --> 00:04:58.319
will be the key piece
that revives the novel.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.079
Just like Ye Yunzhou,
you'll sacrifice yourself for me

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.600
to restart my story.

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:05.920
No!

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:14.040
I'm still

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.199
that kind and innocent female lead.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.800
And you

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.680
that villainess

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.160
doomed to a tragic end.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:24.199
But in someone else's story,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.720
you're just another "her".

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.800
Dongfang Xi.

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:30.839
Have you heard of this?

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:32.959
Villains

00:05:33.439 --> 00:05:34.560
die from talking too much!

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.319
But heroes die from arrogance!

00:05:46.325 --> 00:05:47.425
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

00:05:52.025 --> 00:05:55.050

00:05:58.475 --> 00:06:00.787
(Addicted to Toxic Love)

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.439
(I can't get rid of this book.)

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:04.759
(And it doesn't burn.)

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.120
Xi.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.160
We tried,

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:10.279
but we couldn't destroy this novel.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.759
No matter what Dongfang Yan and I did,

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.279
we just couldn't get rid of this novel.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.920
Who would've thought you,
the heroine, could do it?

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:20.000
What did you say?

00:06:22.839 --> 00:06:24.439
My kind heroine,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.920
how does it feel to ruin your own story?

00:07:05.839 --> 00:07:06.720
Dongfang Yan!

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:12.360
Thank you for destroying the book

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:15.319
and bringing me back.

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:16.759
No way.

00:07:17.519 --> 00:07:18.600
No way.

00:07:19.199 --> 00:07:21.040
I'm the heroine...

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.639
I'm the heroine...

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.560
I'm the heroine...

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.600
Dongfang Yan.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.680
I'm returning this world

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.800
and myself

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.720
to you.

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.360
You're done for.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.560
You vanished for ten years,

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.639
without a single explanation.

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.680
Now you're suddenly home.

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:13.160
Mom and Dad will probably kick you out.

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.360
No matter what happens,

00:08:18.839 --> 00:08:20.000
I'll take responsibility.

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:23.720
What a day it's been.

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.360
You're back, Yan.

00:08:28.759 --> 00:08:29.279
Mom.

00:08:30.079 --> 00:08:31.399
Here, let's have some tea.

00:08:31.759 --> 00:08:32.799
Dongfang Chen.

00:08:33.559 --> 00:08:34.600
Dongfang Chen!

00:08:35.159 --> 00:08:36.000
Don't run!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.440
Yan.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.519
You're back.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.399
You're back, Yan.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.360
Yeah, I'm back.

00:08:49.679 --> 00:08:50.840
I'm not leaving again.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.440
It's rare to have
the whole family together.

00:08:56.799 --> 00:08:57.679
Forget about

00:08:57.679 --> 00:08:58.600
the tea.

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:00.159
Get me that bottle of wine
I've been keeping.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:01.159
That one.

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:01.600
Hurry.

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:02.120
Yes.

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.720
We've got to drink tonight.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.960
Talk some sense into your dad, Xi.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.200
I've been reluctant to drink it.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:05.890
But I'm happy tonight.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:07.480
Coming.

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.120
Is it the one, Mom?

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.480
That's the one.

00:09:09.679 --> 00:09:10.480
It's my precious one.

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.240
Come on.

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:12.799
We'll have it today.

00:09:12.799 --> 00:09:13.559
Let's just do as Dad says.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.240
One, two.
