Previously on
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:37.905
We’ve only known each other
for a week.

00:00:39.188 --> 00:00:42.441
But in that one week,
I’ve seen you cry twice.

00:00:44.454 --> 00:00:46.622
Can I be the one instead?

00:00:48.124 --> 00:00:49.917
I promise I won’t make you cry.

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:52.545
Do you know Drake Palma?

00:00:52.587 --> 00:00:53.604
He’s my cousin.

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:54.689
No way?!

00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:56.090
Our dads are brothers.

00:00:56.466 --> 00:00:57.625
We’re both Palmas,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.427
and both handsome.

00:01:00.178 --> 00:01:01.345
It runs in the blood.

00:01:01.554 --> 00:01:03.931
I think this is where we end.

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:06.100
Are you breaking up with me?

00:01:06.434 --> 00:01:07.602
Please, let me go.

00:01:08.519 --> 00:01:10.146
Breaking up is a mutual decision.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.607
And I don’t wanna break up with you.

00:01:13.524 --> 00:01:14.817
We fight...

00:01:15.443 --> 00:01:16.736
then apologize.

00:01:17.779 --> 00:01:19.906
Then I give in again.

00:01:25.286 --> 00:01:28.372
Four down, one to go.

00:01:28.372 --> 00:01:31.542
Just one more, and you’ll
get a feel of my joke.

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:07.120
I’ll just head home,
there’s an emergency.

00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:09.205
I’ll take you home.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:25.555
You don’t deserve to
be treated this way, Alys.

00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:28.850
No one should make you cry.

00:03:31.858 --> 00:03:35.778
[In French] Only you
I love you, Drake Palma!

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:31.389
Alys!

00:04:40.356 --> 00:04:41.649
Alys, honey...

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.408
Alys, are you okay?

00:04:50.658 --> 00:04:51.717
I’m okay.

00:04:51.742 --> 00:04:55.037
Aunt Liana, I missed you!

00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.290
What brings you here, Aunt?

00:04:57.415 --> 00:05:02.712
I just landed from Singapore and
I want to give you your presents.

00:05:02.753 --> 00:05:05.381
What? Aunt, thank you!

00:05:05.423 --> 00:05:06.774
You’re welcome.

00:05:06.799 --> 00:05:08.551
By the way, is your Mom here?

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.638
I think she’s meeting with a client,
and Dad’s still at the office.

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.599
Good. You know I
can’t handle your Mom.

00:05:17.018 --> 00:05:19.854
I don’t understand why
she and Mom can’t get along.

00:05:20.313 --> 00:05:22.440
They’re both kind and pretty.

00:05:23.482 --> 00:05:26.319
Their jobs are even related,
since Mom is a designer

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.904
and Aunt’s an
event coordinator.

00:05:29.488 --> 00:05:30.489
It’s so weird.

00:05:31.157 --> 00:05:33.137
Aunt, do you want some snacks?

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.786
Yes, perfect—I’m starving!

00:05:35.811 --> 00:05:36.854
Let’s go, then!

00:05:37.163 --> 00:05:40.082
You know what, Aunt, I’m
really glad you’re here.

00:05:41.876 --> 00:05:44.170
At least, I have someone to talk to.

00:05:44.754 --> 00:05:46.464
And I won’t cry alone anymore.

00:05:47.006 --> 00:05:50.760
I didn’t live for 17 years
just to cry all the time.

00:05:52.386 --> 00:05:54.138
So…

00:05:55.973 --> 00:05:57.475
So, what?

00:05:58.267 --> 00:05:59.435
Tell me the story.

00:05:59.643 --> 00:06:03.603
Because your Daddy said
you already have a boyfriend.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:05.005
You want to talk about him?

00:06:05.983 --> 00:06:08.277
Dad is such a gossip!

00:06:08.778 --> 00:06:10.112
Ugh, it’s so annoying!

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.908
But no, Aunt—
Tripp is not my boyfriend!

00:06:14.184 --> 00:06:15.785
He and Drake are cousins.

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:17.953
Do you expect me to jump
from one cousin to another?

00:06:17.995 --> 00:06:19.221
No way.

00:06:19.387 --> 00:06:20.442
What did you say?

00:06:21.131 --> 00:06:23.467
It’s nothing, Aunt. Don’t mind me.

00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:26.712
Anyway, your Dad said,

00:06:28.506 --> 00:06:29.924
Tripp is nice.

00:06:30.122 --> 00:06:31.270
Oh no, Aunt!

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:34.340
Tripp is far from nice.
He’s so mean.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.606
He’s always teasing me!

00:06:37.014 --> 00:06:38.182
Tell me more about him.

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:40.864
Fine, okay.

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:44.772
So, Tripp and I first met
during Freshman Walk.

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:48.426
Actually, I had a boyfriend that time,
so I treated him coldly.

00:06:48.943 --> 00:06:50.611
He asked me to be his partner.

00:06:50.824 --> 00:06:51.824
- How about us instead?
- Huh?

00:06:52.975 --> 00:06:54.143
I have a boyfriend.

00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:56.873
I didn’t know it was
a buddy system.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:00.270
Since I didn’t have
a choice, I went for it.

00:07:00.538 --> 00:07:02.748
But he was so annoying, because—

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:04.262
What’s your name again?

00:07:04.708 --> 00:07:05.739
Tripp Marco.

00:07:06.544 --> 00:07:07.770
Remember it.

00:07:07.795 --> 00:07:08.715
Hello, Tripp!

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:09.908
I hope we become friends.

00:07:10.774 --> 00:07:12.359
- Friends?
- Mmm.

00:07:13.551 --> 00:07:14.360
We’ll see.

00:07:14.385 --> 00:07:15.861
I was surprised that he
suddenly got grumpy.

00:07:15.886 --> 00:07:18.347
He walked out on me,
and I was thinking,

00:07:18.347 --> 00:07:20.408
What’s his problem?

00:07:20.534 --> 00:07:22.035
As if it’s my fault.

00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:24.186
So, I ran after him.

00:07:24.812 --> 00:07:25.812
Hey, Tripp!

00:07:29.275 --> 00:07:30.317
Are you giving up?

00:07:30.609 --> 00:07:31.660
It’s because...

00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:33.574
Why are you being so grumpy?

00:07:34.363 --> 00:07:36.949
We just met, and you’re already
snapping at me?

00:07:39.535 --> 00:07:41.579
Then, we were okay,
we became friends.

00:07:42.207 --> 00:07:45.727
But one time,
I really appreciated him.

00:07:45.752 --> 00:07:48.713
Because honestly, Aunt, I
was being bullied in school.

00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:53.777
One time, some girls threw coffee on me.
I didn’t even know them.

00:07:53.935 --> 00:07:55.228
And he was there.

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.975
They ganged up on me.

00:07:58.889 --> 00:07:59.979
Alys…

00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:03.395
He lent me his jacket, then
came with me to buy clothes.

00:08:03.436 --> 00:08:04.938
But you know what’s so annoying?

00:08:05.021 --> 00:08:08.150
I told him I’d ride his motorcycle
on one condition.

00:08:09.109 --> 00:08:10.277
He had to go slow.

00:08:10.402 --> 00:08:11.837
Are you ready?

00:08:11.862 --> 00:08:13.125
Let’s go.

00:08:14.865 --> 00:08:15.715
Tripp!

00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:16.860
Don’t speed up!

00:08:17.409 --> 00:08:18.453
Tripp! Stop!

00:08:19.427 --> 00:08:20.720
I wanted to strangle him!

00:08:20.753 --> 00:08:23.849
My soul was left
on the street.

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:25.220
And then...

00:08:26.268 --> 00:08:29.396
He texted me when he saw me
crying because of Drake.

00:08:29.695 --> 00:08:32.239
I can only tolerate you
crying five times, Alys.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.126
That’s your third already.

00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:39.096
When you reach five,

00:08:39.748 --> 00:08:41.417
I’ll make my joke real.

00:08:43.618 --> 00:08:46.430
He said, “Four down, one to go”

00:08:46.455 --> 00:08:48.932
What does that joke mean?

00:08:48.957 --> 00:08:50.819
Honestly, I don’t know.

00:08:50.844 --> 00:08:53.523
Does he mean he wants
to be my boyfriend?

00:08:54.398 --> 00:08:56.250
What a joke. He’s annoying.

00:08:59.024 --> 00:09:02.062
You know what, for once,
I agree with your Dad.

00:09:02.817 --> 00:09:04.531
Tripp seems nice.

00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:08.101
So why don’t you just
dump that jerk boyfriend?

00:09:40.823 --> 00:09:42.673
- Drake?!
- Ssshhh!

00:09:48.699 --> 00:09:51.827
I thought we were leaving?

00:09:52.465 --> 00:09:53.525
Hold my hand.

00:09:53.996 --> 00:09:55.009
Huh?

00:09:55.915 --> 00:09:57.458
You said I lack affection, right?

00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:00.438
Hold my hand. Let’s go.

00:10:28.089 --> 00:10:29.142
Wait.

00:10:29.719 --> 00:10:31.721
Looks like you got upset
by what I said.

00:10:32.284 --> 00:10:33.285
No.

00:10:34.286 --> 00:10:35.996
I can’t, Aunt.

00:10:38.686 --> 00:10:40.187
I don’t know.

00:10:40.743 --> 00:10:44.255
No matter how badly Drake
treats me,

00:10:45.673 --> 00:10:48.634
it never crossed my
mind to leave him.

00:10:49.837 --> 00:10:50.838
Do you love him?

00:10:52.388 --> 00:10:53.556
He’s a part of me.

00:10:56.141 --> 00:10:58.310
I love him despite his flaws.

00:11:01.063 --> 00:11:06.819
Isn’t loving someone means
loving them completely and unconditionally?

00:11:15.801 --> 00:11:19.805
Seriously? It’s become my default
that whenever I cry, I look for tripp.

00:11:20.791 --> 00:11:24.420
Maybe he’ll suddenly show up
and send me some random text.

00:11:26.046 --> 00:11:28.674
Aww, our baby is now a lady.

00:11:29.216 --> 00:11:30.968
Alys, I’m so proud of you.

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.055
By the way...

00:11:33.887 --> 00:11:35.681
What do you
want for your birthday?

00:11:37.202 --> 00:11:38.200
Oh, my gosh!

00:11:38.225 --> 00:11:41.603
My birthday’s coming up soon.
My debut is next week.

00:11:41.937 --> 00:11:43.314
Yes, so what do you want?

00:11:44.356 --> 00:11:48.457
Aunt Liana, do you think you
could convince Dad to get me a condo?

00:11:49.628 --> 00:11:50.791
- Condo?
- Mm-hmm!

00:11:50.816 --> 00:11:53.382
Why? You don’t want to
live with your Mom?

00:11:53.407 --> 00:11:55.117
Oh, because she’s strict, right?

00:11:55.868 --> 00:11:57.077
No, it’s not that, Aunt.

00:11:57.077 --> 00:11:59.038
I really love my mom,
it’s just that…

00:12:01.974 --> 00:12:04.435
I just want to live next to Drake.

00:12:07.338 --> 00:12:08.797
Come on, Aunt!

00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.738
Do you think I’m
being too clingy?

00:12:12.087 --> 00:12:13.668
Is it a dumb decision?

00:12:14.011 --> 00:12:15.638
I don’t know, it’s just that…

00:12:16.096 --> 00:12:20.726
Drake and I have been together so
long, and we’ve been through so much.

00:12:21.685 --> 00:12:23.646
Really fun and happy ones.

00:12:24.281 --> 00:12:26.575
Of course, I won’t just give up!

00:12:26.732 --> 00:12:29.221
I’m already here—why
would I back out now?

00:12:29.902 --> 00:12:33.322
So, now I understand
why you want a condo.

00:12:33.871 --> 00:12:39.720
So, I will tell your Dad
and convince him for you.

00:12:39.745 --> 00:12:42.081
Yay! Thank you so much, Aunt!

00:12:42.106 --> 00:12:43.858
Okay, I’ll send
you the address.

00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:50.126
I think I’ve kept quiet long enough.

00:12:50.643 --> 00:12:53.104
It’s time for me to be territorial, too.

00:12:59.031 --> 00:13:00.616
The Cove Tower?

00:13:00.641 --> 00:13:01.809
Yes!

00:13:01.809 --> 00:13:03.688
This is a nice condo.

00:13:03.713 --> 00:13:09.275
Yes, I hope Dad or Daddy or anyone
agrees, I just really want a condo!

00:13:11.361 --> 00:13:14.323
I will try, okay, for
your birthday.

00:13:14.348 --> 00:13:16.430
- I’ll try to convince him.
- Thank you so much, Aunt!

00:13:16.455 --> 00:13:17.525
Thank you!

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.970
Thank you, Aunt.
I really missed you!

00:13:21.995 --> 00:13:23.247
I love you, kiddo.

00:13:23.622 --> 00:13:25.332
I love you, too, Aunt.

00:13:33.632 --> 00:13:34.925
So, where’s Drake?

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.105
He’s at his condo.

00:13:49.898 --> 00:13:51.431
Tell him to come by tomorrow.

00:13:51.456 --> 00:13:52.666
He’s your escort, right?

00:13:55.988 --> 00:13:57.531
Oh, okay.

00:14:00.367 --> 00:14:02.252
Maybe Sheen could
be my partner instead?

00:14:03.412 --> 00:14:05.314
I’m sure Drake won’t even agree.

00:14:06.665 --> 00:14:08.783
But I’ll try calling him later.

00:14:10.252 --> 00:14:12.564
I don’t want to talk to him in
person—it’s nerve-wracking.

00:14:14.131 --> 00:14:17.176
Oh, by the way, Dane is
coming home next week.

00:14:17.756 --> 00:14:18.806
For real?!

00:14:19.132 --> 00:14:20.550
Sorry, I was just shocked.

00:14:20.745 --> 00:14:22.002
Really?!

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:23.132
Yeah!

00:14:23.157 --> 00:14:27.745
Since next week is your debut,
your birthday, it’s going to be very fun.

00:14:27.770 --> 00:14:30.063
Dane has to be here
to spend a week with us.

00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:31.890
Felice is going to be happy.

00:14:31.915 --> 00:14:36.062
You know those two, they were
lovebirds before he went to the States.

00:14:36.087 --> 00:14:37.839
Yeah, Felice will come too.

00:14:38.197 --> 00:14:43.494
You know what, I think your debut is
gonna be very beautiful, my baby!

00:14:43.494 --> 00:14:44.845
I hope so, Mom.

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:47.181
- I’m sure it’s gonna be beautiful.
- Oh, yeah!

00:14:47.206 --> 00:14:48.307
It’s because of you, Mom!

00:15:08.435 --> 00:15:09.435
What now?

00:15:10.877 --> 00:15:12.129
Should I call him?

00:15:22.574 --> 00:15:24.535
What if he says no?

00:15:33.669 --> 00:15:35.921
Do I apologize for what I said?

00:15:42.886 --> 00:15:44.785
But why would I apologize?

00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:47.629
Gosh!

00:15:47.891 --> 00:15:48.891
I’ll take my chances.

00:15:52.395 --> 00:15:53.396
Okay.

00:16:01.071 --> 00:16:02.322
Drake, please, pick up.

00:16:13.834 --> 00:16:14.834
Hello?

00:16:17.379 --> 00:16:18.922
Uhm, why are you calling?

00:16:23.319 --> 00:16:25.238
I take back saying sorry.

00:16:29.349 --> 00:16:31.977
Hello? And why do you
have Drake’s phone?

00:16:33.896 --> 00:16:35.522
What do you even care?

00:16:36.547 --> 00:16:38.090
Why are you calling?

00:16:38.115 --> 00:16:39.491
Please give him the phone.

00:16:40.319 --> 00:16:41.319
Please.

00:16:42.404 --> 00:16:44.012
He’s asleep!

00:16:44.114 --> 00:16:47.130
I’m not going to wake
him up for you! Duh!

00:16:47.993 --> 00:16:49.411
What are you doing
in Drake’s condo?

00:16:50.162 --> 00:16:51.622
Please tell me
you’re just studying.

00:16:52.456 --> 00:16:53.874
Take a guess.

00:16:55.667 --> 00:16:56.667
Shai—!

00:16:57.920 --> 00:16:59.434
You’re such a leech!

00:17:11.099 --> 00:17:12.726
Just a little more
patience, Alys.

00:17:14.603 --> 00:17:15.646
Don’t give up yet.

00:17:18.815 --> 00:17:20.400
I want you to only give up,

00:17:22.595 --> 00:17:24.881
when you can say
you’ve given it your all.

00:17:27.282 --> 00:17:29.076
You’ve done absolutely everything.

00:17:30.702 --> 00:17:32.079
So don’t you dare say...

00:17:33.038 --> 00:17:34.998
don’t you dare say I left you.

00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.176
Today is a brand new day.

00:17:44.633 --> 00:17:46.051
I’m going to class again.

00:17:46.802 --> 00:17:47.950
But Lord...

00:17:48.804 --> 00:17:51.264
please, I hope I won’t
see anyone today.

00:17:51.658 --> 00:17:55.537
I hope there won’t be no problems,
no issues, nothing!

00:17:56.228 --> 00:17:59.106
Lord please, I just
want to study in peace.

00:18:03.318 --> 00:18:05.278
And I hope I won’t
run into Tripp.

00:18:05.821 --> 00:18:08.198
I still keep thinking
about what he said.

00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:09.638
It’s really confusing.

00:18:10.059 --> 00:18:11.227
Are you avoiding me?

00:18:12.786 --> 00:18:13.786
Tripp!

00:18:15.831 --> 00:18:18.208
I said are you avoiding me?

00:18:22.395 --> 00:18:23.395
Good.

00:18:24.798 --> 00:18:26.633
Because when you brought me
into your life,

00:18:28.427 --> 00:18:29.553
I never planned on leaving.

00:18:30.279 --> 00:18:32.176
- You and your cheesy lines!
- Ouch!

00:18:33.306 --> 00:18:34.433
Hey, where are you going?

00:18:35.559 --> 00:18:37.227
Uhm...to my class.

00:18:37.524 --> 00:18:38.870
I’ll take you.

00:18:38.895 --> 00:18:40.161
No need.

00:18:40.402 --> 00:18:41.645
Go ahead, just go.

00:18:46.903 --> 00:18:48.317
Fine, I’ll go first.

00:18:50.476 --> 00:18:51.310
Hey!

00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:52.217
I’m easy to talk to.

00:18:52.242 --> 00:18:54.386
You’re so sensitive!
Come on, let’s go.

00:18:54.411 --> 00:18:55.497
Okay, fine.

00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:56.930
Let’s go.

00:18:56.955 --> 00:18:58.020
Take me.

00:19:07.883 --> 00:19:10.218
Why is Tripp looking
more handsome?

00:19:10.432 --> 00:19:11.432
Damn!

00:19:22.064 --> 00:19:23.817
Let’s go, I’ll take you.

00:19:24.274 --> 00:19:25.565
Let’s go, you’re so persistent.

00:19:25.590 --> 00:19:27.098
You’re playing hard to get.

00:19:27.375 --> 00:19:28.835
Whatever you say.

00:19:33.033 --> 00:19:34.034
You’re sitting pretty there.

00:19:34.076 --> 00:19:36.344
- You’re going to get scolded later.
- Classmate!

00:19:36.369 --> 00:19:38.055
Hey, I’m early today!

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.348
Yes, I have a new life now.

00:19:40.373 --> 00:19:41.442
Hi!

00:19:43.418 --> 00:19:44.961
I hope there’s
nothing to do today.

00:19:51.718 --> 00:19:52.822
What are you doing here?

00:19:52.846 --> 00:19:54.139
Don’t you have a class?

00:19:54.548 --> 00:19:55.548
Free cut.

00:19:55.972 --> 00:19:57.145
Thought I’d sit in here.

00:19:58.416 --> 00:19:59.876
Okay, it’s up to you.

00:20:07.734 --> 00:20:08.734
Uhm...

00:20:09.736 --> 00:20:10.736
Tripp?

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:12.822
Yes?

00:20:13.275 --> 00:20:15.051
- Can I ask you something?
- Mmm?

00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:18.817
You said you’ll always
be on my side, right?

00:20:21.832 --> 00:20:23.911
You won’t ever fool me, right?

00:20:26.617 --> 00:20:29.245
I think I’m starting to
have trust issues with guys.

00:20:31.223 --> 00:20:32.223
Zy...

00:20:33.385 --> 00:20:34.970
I won’t play you, promise.

00:20:35.929 --> 00:20:37.973
My cousin fooled you,
so why would I?

00:20:47.399 --> 00:20:48.608
Do you know Shaira?

00:20:50.235 --> 00:20:51.247
Shaira?

00:20:51.570 --> 00:20:52.653
Yes.

00:20:53.363 --> 00:20:56.007
But we don’t talk anymore.

00:20:56.032 --> 00:20:57.032
Why?

00:20:59.901 --> 00:21:00.901
Nothing.

00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:07.419
How close is she with Drake?

00:21:13.249 --> 00:21:14.249
Close?

00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:16.966
I have no idea.

00:21:18.874 --> 00:21:21.668
Because when Drake
and I were in second year,

00:21:22.893 --> 00:21:27.022
he suddenly got quieter,
and Shaira turned snobbish.

00:21:28.296 --> 00:21:31.051
But she used to be nice,

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:38.044
the only problem was when
Drake kind of had a girlfriend,

00:21:38.491 --> 00:21:39.833
Shaira turned mean.

00:21:41.453 --> 00:21:42.453
Why are you asking?

00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.637
Oh, so it was because
of Aunt Katrina.

00:21:47.626 --> 00:21:51.458
If it weren’t for her, Drake and Shaira
would probably be together now!

00:21:51.713 --> 00:21:53.215
Am I really the one
butting in?

00:21:56.134 --> 00:21:57.134
Nothing.

00:21:59.846 --> 00:22:02.641
Okay class, take your seats
and please get your assignments.

00:22:02.666 --> 00:22:03.806
Alright, I’ll go ahead.

00:22:05.602 --> 00:22:07.312
- Bye!
- Bye.

00:22:12.734 --> 00:22:14.900
So, where are we really going?

00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:17.155
I just want to check
out this art bar nearby.

00:22:17.822 --> 00:22:19.626
Good thing it’s my vacant
time. You always suddenly–

00:22:19.651 --> 00:22:21.635
Tripp, son! Oh—

00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.494
- Dad?
- I’ve been looking for you!

00:22:25.038 --> 00:22:26.723
Who is this with you?

00:22:26.748 --> 00:22:28.830
- Oh, I’m Alys—
- My girlfriend.

00:22:30.178 --> 00:22:31.596
- What, girlfriend?
- Oh!

00:22:32.337 --> 00:22:34.384
So, you’re my son’s girlfriend?

00:22:34.714 --> 00:22:35.714
I’m his Dad.

00:22:37.884 --> 00:22:39.903
- Nice to meet you!
- You can call me Uncle Tristan.

00:22:39.928 --> 00:22:40.931
Okay.

00:22:41.308 --> 00:22:42.766
You look really pretty, dear.

00:22:42.791 --> 00:22:44.376
Oh, thank you!

00:22:45.141 --> 00:22:47.603
Wait, I’ll introduce you to
Tripp’s cousin.

00:22:47.686 --> 00:22:49.312
Let me just call Drake, okay.

00:22:50.230 --> 00:22:51.230
Drake, come here!

00:22:57.946 --> 00:22:59.048
Oh, sh–!

00:22:59.572 --> 00:23:00.751
By the way, this is–

00:23:09.756 --> 00:23:10.884
Drake!

00:23:11.107 --> 00:23:12.126
Drake!

00:23:12.384 --> 00:23:13.736
Drake, let go of me!

00:23:14.087 --> 00:23:16.642
Drake, can you please
let go, you’re hurting me!

00:23:22.595 --> 00:23:23.595
Sorry.

00:23:25.129 --> 00:23:26.129
Sorry?

00:23:26.683 --> 00:23:27.809
“Sorry” again?

00:23:29.060 --> 00:23:30.060
Why are you with him?

00:23:31.271 --> 00:23:32.355
Stupid question.

00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:34.190
Of course, you’re together.

00:23:35.525 --> 00:23:36.525
Wow.

00:23:37.527 --> 00:23:39.838
Are you accusing me
of cheating on you?

00:23:39.863 --> 00:23:41.114
Why, aren’t you?

00:23:41.573 --> 00:23:42.465
Wow!

00:23:42.669 --> 00:23:44.630
Should I faint right now?

00:23:44.784 --> 00:23:45.725
Me?!

00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:47.586
You’re accusing me
of cheating?

00:23:48.121 --> 00:23:49.253
Huh?!

00:23:49.278 --> 00:23:51.082
Are you out of your
goddamned mind?!

00:23:51.107 --> 00:23:52.707
No! You—are you
out of your mind?!

00:23:52.732 --> 00:23:53.887
No, I’m not!

00:23:54.169 --> 00:23:55.219
Then, why were
you with my cousin?

00:23:55.244 --> 00:23:56.676
Well, why were you with Shaira?

00:23:57.422 --> 00:23:58.422
There.

00:23:58.757 --> 00:24:02.052
I asked!
Just to be fair, right?

00:24:02.658 --> 00:24:03.863
I was busy.

00:24:04.175 --> 00:24:05.175
Busy?

00:24:06.431 --> 00:24:07.657
Busy with what?

00:24:07.829 --> 00:24:11.625
Were you so busy that you
didn’t think of me for five minutes?

00:24:14.606 --> 00:24:15.606
Alys...

00:24:16.534 --> 00:24:17.903
Trust me on this one, okay?

00:24:19.736 --> 00:24:20.736
Trust?

00:24:24.117 --> 00:24:26.129
It’s so hard to trust you, Drake.

00:24:26.659 --> 00:24:29.419
Because every time I do,
I’m the one who gets hurt.

00:24:30.455 --> 00:24:32.387
I’m the one crying alone.

00:24:34.793 --> 00:24:36.505
I’m the one who gets tired.

00:24:38.213 --> 00:24:40.548
Even if I don’t want to
be paranoid, it’s so hard.

00:24:40.548 --> 00:24:43.997
What can I do if there’s a Shaira who’s
willing to snatch you away anytime?

00:24:45.470 --> 00:24:46.973
Since when did
you get so stubborn?

00:24:47.555 --> 00:24:48.731
Since last week.

00:24:49.224 --> 00:24:52.403
We’ve been apart for so long, so
much has changed in me, Drake.

00:24:54.291 --> 00:24:56.418
Why? Did you miss me?

00:24:57.069 --> 00:25:00.583
In those three weeks we weren’t
together, did I ever cross your mind?

00:25:03.988 --> 00:25:05.490
Even just once?

00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.120
Let’s go home.

00:25:12.038 --> 00:25:13.456
Huh? What?

00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:22.132
Seriously, after everything I
said, “let’s go home” is all you’ve got?

00:25:22.367 --> 00:25:24.119
Wow, you’re really something!

00:25:36.563 --> 00:25:41.334
My gosh! One kiss and
all my anger disappears!

00:25:41.359 --> 00:25:42.919
So unfair!

00:25:42.944 --> 00:25:44.630
I should be mad right now!

00:25:57.959 --> 00:25:59.090
What’s going on?

00:25:59.627 --> 00:26:00.979
Family reunion.

00:26:01.004 --> 00:26:01.997
What?

00:26:02.797 --> 00:26:04.747
- Your entire clan is inside?
- Mmm.

00:26:05.276 --> 00:26:06.276
What?!

00:26:07.427 --> 00:26:10.013
Your whole clan’s inside,
having a reunion, and look at me—

00:26:10.038 --> 00:26:12.934
I’m in my CA uniform
with a strawberry stain?!

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:14.848
I’m not going in.

00:26:15.602 --> 00:26:16.619
Stubborn.

00:26:16.644 --> 00:26:17.919
Dad’s expecting you.

00:26:18.605 --> 00:26:21.291
I don’t want to! I look so ugly!

00:26:21.316 --> 00:26:24.127
My cousins are ugly
too—you’ll blend in.

00:26:24.221 --> 00:26:26.606
Wow, thanks for that.

00:26:28.239 --> 00:26:30.241
Fine, get out, I’ll change clothes.

00:26:30.704 --> 00:26:31.871
I can stay.

00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.136
Huh?

00:26:33.161 --> 00:26:34.545
Hey, get out!

00:26:35.622 --> 00:26:36.631
Okay.

00:26:37.081 --> 00:26:38.389
Don’t you dare look, okay?

00:26:39.314 --> 00:26:40.314
I’ll try.

00:27:02.565 --> 00:27:03.858
My beautiful girlfriend.

00:27:10.323 --> 00:27:11.323
Let’s go.

00:27:18.414 --> 00:27:19.349
Hi!

00:27:19.374 --> 00:27:20.266
Thank you so much.

00:27:20.291 --> 00:27:21.125
Hi, Drake!

00:27:21.167 --> 00:27:22.293
The baby will
definitely love that.

00:27:22.335 --> 00:27:23.294
Uncle Steve!

00:27:23.336 --> 00:27:24.420
The one in the
shower will be different!

00:27:24.462 --> 00:27:25.797
I missed you!

00:27:25.838 --> 00:27:26.873
Thanks!

00:27:27.882 --> 00:27:29.926
- Hi, Aunt Katrina!
- Hi, Alys!

00:27:30.593 --> 00:27:31.694
Drake!

00:27:31.719 --> 00:27:32.737
Where’s Aya?

00:27:32.762 --> 00:27:34.381
We have so much food!

00:27:35.557 --> 00:27:37.701
Oh gosh, Uncle, Aya?
I don’t know where she is.

00:27:38.184 --> 00:27:40.161
Wait, I’ll just entertain
some other guests, okay?

00:27:40.186 --> 00:27:41.437
Okay, thank you!

00:27:41.479 --> 00:27:42.545
See you later.

00:27:46.067 --> 00:27:47.710
We’re still at war.

00:27:47.735 --> 00:27:49.889
I just let that moment slide.

00:27:50.177 --> 00:27:51.047
After this,

00:27:51.072 --> 00:27:56.850
I won’t talk to you again until you tell
me why you were with that octopus Shaira!

00:27:57.954 --> 00:28:00.881
Alys, let me introduce
you to my relatives.

00:28:00.906 --> 00:28:04.284
My cousins—Lucas and
Teodoro—they’re Palmas, too.

00:28:04.335 --> 00:28:05.461
- Hello, Uncle!
- This is Alys.

00:28:05.461 --> 00:28:06.546
Hello, Uncle!

00:28:09.716 --> 00:28:11.175
Tristan! Tristan!

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.577
Hey! What’s up?

00:28:14.887 --> 00:28:16.072
Ugh, this guy!

00:28:16.097 --> 00:28:19.592
Is he trying to kill me
with stress and nervousness?

00:28:20.518 --> 00:28:22.889
This is Drake’s girlfriend.
She is Alys.

00:28:23.438 --> 00:28:24.857
- Oh, hello.
- Girlfriend?

00:28:24.882 --> 00:28:25.936
Yes.

00:28:32.931 --> 00:28:34.015
Hi!

00:28:34.282 --> 00:28:35.756
Wait, I’ll come to you.

00:28:39.329 --> 00:28:40.936
Oh…uhm…

00:28:40.961 --> 00:28:42.233
I dumped her.

00:28:43.124 --> 00:28:44.250
She was boring.

00:28:44.463 --> 00:28:46.048
Then she and Drake
ended up together.

00:28:46.753 --> 00:28:47.865
Cool, right?

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:50.404
Are you serious?

00:28:51.835 --> 00:28:52.927
So, we’re good?

00:28:53.718 --> 00:28:55.094
We’re good, right, Alys?

00:28:56.299 --> 00:28:57.299
We’re good.

00:28:59.108 --> 00:29:01.643
- Let’s go.
- What? I don’t know with you!

00:29:03.144 --> 00:29:03.770
You’re so annoying!

00:29:03.811 --> 00:29:06.122
Are you crazy—
Am I a playgirl?

00:29:06.147 --> 00:29:07.350
I was just joking!

00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:08.808
What joke?

00:29:08.833 --> 00:29:10.752
If it was just a joke,
you should’ve told your dad.

00:29:10.777 --> 00:29:13.225
He might think
I’m some dirty girl.

00:29:15.406 --> 00:29:16.783
Ouch! Ouch!

00:29:16.808 --> 00:29:17.772
Hey, that hurts!

00:29:18.451 --> 00:29:19.795
You’re so annoying!

00:29:20.036 --> 00:29:22.225
Well, you practically
called me a dirty guy, too!

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:25.436
Your drama won’t work
on me anymore, got it?

00:29:25.875 --> 00:29:26.834
You’re so irritating!

00:29:26.834 --> 00:29:28.294
Take back what
you said to your dad.

00:29:28.336 --> 00:29:29.420
No way!

00:29:29.837 --> 00:29:31.378
Tripp, come on!

00:29:31.403 --> 00:29:32.404
I said no.

00:29:32.757 --> 00:29:34.592
Please, Tripp!

00:29:35.259 --> 00:29:38.179
Just this once, let me
ask this favor from you!

00:29:39.097 --> 00:29:41.225
I said no!

00:29:49.107 --> 00:29:50.107
Tripp is so weird.

00:29:50.983 --> 00:29:54.912
He’s so good at teasing, but
sometimes, he looks so sad.

00:29:55.718 --> 00:29:59.864
Sometimes when I pity him,
I just want to hug him.

00:30:02.203 --> 00:30:03.203
Hey.

00:30:05.331 --> 00:30:06.331
Hey!

00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.751
Fine, yes!

00:30:10.211 --> 00:30:11.379
But that’s the last time, okay?

00:30:11.379 --> 00:30:12.505
Don’t do it again.

00:30:18.594 --> 00:30:20.405
You’re too nice, you know that?

00:30:20.936 --> 00:30:22.115
I know!

00:30:24.767 --> 00:30:25.936
Sometimes, try being grumpy.

00:30:27.311 --> 00:30:28.631
You’re way too lovable.

00:30:29.564 --> 00:30:30.415
Ouch!

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:34.670
Do that again and
you’ll be in trouble.

00:30:35.862 --> 00:30:38.114
That’s the problem with you.

00:30:39.217 --> 00:30:42.660
You don’t take what I say seriously.

00:30:43.228 --> 00:30:44.938
That’s going to be a problem,
you’ll see.

00:30:46.289 --> 00:30:48.115
I don’t want to entertain him.

00:30:48.207 --> 00:30:51.264
He talks too much,
all pick-up lines.

00:30:51.919 --> 00:30:53.928
That’s why I keep smacking him.

00:30:56.424 --> 00:31:01.904
People think he’s my boyfriend
number two because we’re close.

00:31:02.037 --> 00:31:03.497
As if I have a choice!

00:31:06.601 --> 00:31:07.912
Just tell me a story.

00:31:09.312 --> 00:31:10.639
What do you want?

00:31:11.063 --> 00:31:13.787
A happy one? A sad one?

00:31:14.275 --> 00:31:18.178
Or maybe a funny one
so we can just laugh it off?

00:31:19.950 --> 00:31:21.099
Anything.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:27.597
He said he’s serious!

00:31:27.622 --> 00:31:29.682
He said it’s “symbolism”!

00:31:29.707 --> 00:31:31.490
What kind of art is that?!

00:31:32.822 --> 00:31:34.699
Only he would think
of something like that!

00:31:42.845 --> 00:31:47.992
You know what, Tripp, you’re like someone
I’d bring home and put in a pet cage!

00:31:48.017 --> 00:31:49.959
You’re like a parrot, you
never run out of things to say!

00:31:57.784 --> 00:32:00.495
Um, Tripp…

00:32:04.659 --> 00:32:06.160
Why are you always sad?

00:32:07.537 --> 00:32:09.514
Huh? Am I sad?

00:32:14.264 --> 00:32:18.560
It’s weird, but even when you smile,

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.428
I can see and tell that you’re sad.

00:32:36.274 --> 00:32:38.251
Hey, I’m your friend, right?

00:32:38.471 --> 00:32:39.638
Share something with me.

00:32:43.197 --> 00:32:45.964
Sorry if I get weird sometimes.

00:32:48.087 --> 00:32:49.087
It’s just that…

00:32:52.039 --> 00:32:53.499
my Mom got married again.

00:32:55.376 --> 00:32:58.045
I thought she and dad
would get back together,

00:32:59.338 --> 00:33:00.506
but they didn’t.

00:33:05.219 --> 00:33:07.430
Family problems are tough.

00:33:08.681 --> 00:33:10.600
I undertand your weirdness.

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:24.070
Alys…

00:33:24.864 --> 00:33:25.864
Mmm?

00:33:38.169 --> 00:33:41.096
Oh, sorry.
I couldn’t help it.

00:33:41.130 --> 00:33:42.675
Okay, I’ll go ahead.

00:33:55.728 --> 00:33:56.728
What was that?

00:33:58.064 --> 00:33:59.221
What just happened?

00:34:01.233 --> 00:34:02.443
Did he leave already?

00:34:02.526 --> 00:34:03.679
Well, he better be.

00:34:03.704 --> 00:34:05.073
He’s so annoying,
I should punch him.

00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:09.143
Where have you been?

00:34:10.223 --> 00:34:11.223
You’ve been gone for so long.

00:34:12.954 --> 00:34:15.164
Uhm…just getting some air.

00:34:15.888 --> 00:34:17.807
Getting some air?
For that long?

00:34:19.251 --> 00:34:22.198
Gosh, I feel guilty.

00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.526
Why do I feel like
I’m the bad one and not Drake?

00:34:26.258 --> 00:34:28.409
Ugh, this is all Tripp’s fault!

00:34:55.746 --> 00:34:58.510
Drake and I need to fix this
before it gets worse.

00:34:59.647 --> 00:35:02.620
I’ll do my best to make
this relationship last.

00:35:04.866 --> 00:35:06.158
What are you thinking?

00:35:07.758 --> 00:35:08.758
Uh...

00:35:10.052 --> 00:35:11.137
Nothing.

00:35:12.930 --> 00:35:14.432
I just missed you.

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.136
So, what’s keeping you busy now?

00:35:27.111 --> 00:35:30.573
Is it Shaira that made you
forget I still exist?

00:35:32.533 --> 00:35:34.243
School works – the usual.

00:35:42.317 --> 00:35:43.317
Drake.

00:35:43.461 --> 00:35:44.461
Mmm?

00:35:48.466 --> 00:35:50.342
Can you please not
make me cry again?

00:35:51.719 --> 00:35:56.588
I’m scared Tripp might take
his joke seriously.

00:35:56.613 --> 00:35:58.239
Promises are meant
to be broken.

00:35:59.577 --> 00:36:01.579
So I’ll just try, okay?

00:36:08.569 --> 00:36:09.653
Drake...

00:36:11.489 --> 00:36:14.033
can you be my
escort for my debut?

00:36:18.788 --> 00:36:19.788
What’s that?

00:36:21.959 --> 00:36:23.586
I just thought...

00:36:24.321 --> 00:36:28.450
it’s different if my boyfriend
will be my escort at my debut.

00:36:29.048 --> 00:36:32.343
Of course, I want my debut
to be a night to remember.

00:36:32.968 --> 00:36:34.053
So...

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.181
yes or yes?

00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.647
I’ll say yes if you
promise me one thing.

00:36:44.563 --> 00:36:45.772
Stop talking to Tripp.

00:36:46.482 --> 00:36:47.482
Huh?

00:36:48.275 --> 00:36:50.528
I said stop talking to Tripp.

00:36:51.153 --> 00:36:52.947
What? Why?

00:36:54.615 --> 00:36:58.329
How can I avoid him when
he’s the one I’m always with?

00:36:59.286 --> 00:37:01.704
You know we can’t
always be together, right?

00:37:03.207 --> 00:37:05.243
I know that.

00:37:08.504 --> 00:37:11.653
Drake, why don’t
we make a truce?

00:37:11.685 --> 00:37:12.811
Mmm, I’m listening.

00:37:13.634 --> 00:37:14.634
Okay.

00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:18.639
I won’t talk to Tripp anymore,

00:37:18.681 --> 00:37:22.977
but you have to promise me
you won’t talk to Shaira either.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:26.142
Why are you so
jealous of Shaira?

00:37:26.939 --> 00:37:28.517
Isn’t it obvious?

00:37:28.724 --> 00:37:30.476
Because you’re always with her!

00:37:30.526 --> 00:37:31.526
Sshh!

00:37:35.788 --> 00:37:39.125
Alys, what else do I need to do?

00:37:40.411 --> 00:37:42.955
To make you believe when
I say it’s only you.

00:37:44.057 --> 00:37:45.212
Hmm?

00:37:50.171 --> 00:37:51.380
Shaira is just a friend.

00:37:54.838 --> 00:37:55.914
I know.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:57.306
She needs me.

00:37:59.930 --> 00:38:01.813
But I need you, too.

00:38:06.395 --> 00:38:07.813
I’m glad you do.

00:38:09.402 --> 00:38:10.695
Because, Alys,

00:38:11.525 --> 00:38:13.110
I need you so much.

00:38:14.602 --> 00:38:15.919
And that it hurts.

00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.287
I know I’m not vocal
about my feelings.

00:38:52.733 --> 00:38:53.733
And I’m sorry.

00:38:55.023 --> 00:38:56.191
Please don’t go away.

00:39:00.157 --> 00:39:02.688
After my dad replaced my late
mom with Katrina,

00:39:03.561 --> 00:39:05.501
I was deeply hurt.

00:39:06.914 --> 00:39:10.220
I told myself love is dispensable.

00:39:12.169 --> 00:39:13.462
I was afraid to love.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:15.547
Until I met you.

00:39:20.010 --> 00:39:21.618
You annoyed the hell out of me.

00:39:22.805 --> 00:39:25.224
Honestly, I didn’t like you then.

00:39:26.767 --> 00:39:29.186
But slowly, you entered my heart.

00:39:30.104 --> 00:39:31.689
And you stayed there.

00:39:35.526 --> 00:39:37.444
My love for you felt different.

00:39:38.946 --> 00:39:40.095
I was surprised.

00:39:40.489 --> 00:39:42.950
I got scared because I
didn’t know how I fell for you.

00:39:44.618 --> 00:39:46.829
I feel like I’m drowning in
everything that’s happening.

00:39:47.788 --> 00:39:49.248
I know I irritate you.

00:39:51.083 --> 00:39:52.376
But, Alys...

00:39:53.669 --> 00:39:54.962
This is who I really am.

00:39:57.381 --> 00:39:59.800
This is how I am.
I can’t change that.

00:40:04.972 --> 00:40:06.515
You’re always in my heart,

00:40:07.336 --> 00:40:09.588
Alys Zyril Palma.

00:40:10.102 --> 00:40:11.478
So, please trust me.

00:40:12.014 --> 00:40:13.432
And don’t leave me.

00:40:15.566 --> 00:40:18.259
I can’t promise to
be the ideal boyfriend,

00:40:19.170 --> 00:40:21.339
because if I make that promise,

00:40:23.574 --> 00:40:25.409
I’ll end up breaking that promise

00:40:26.467 --> 00:40:27.801
over and over again.

00:40:30.245 --> 00:40:31.860
I know that, Drake.

00:40:33.167 --> 00:40:36.165
All I want is for you to
be more open with me.

00:40:37.838 --> 00:40:40.392
I’m not a mind-reader, Drake.

00:40:41.467 --> 00:40:43.969
It’s hard for me to read you.

00:40:45.566 --> 00:40:49.529
We keep misunderstanding
each other because I don’t get you.

00:40:53.562 --> 00:40:55.522
I just wish you’d trust me more.

00:41:02.237 --> 00:41:04.490
I wish you’d trust me enough

00:41:05.195 --> 00:41:07.149
for you to tell me everything—

00:41:07.951 --> 00:41:11.040
everything you think,
everything you feel.

00:41:14.332 --> 00:41:15.332
Sounds fair.

00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.725
Do you promise to be
more open this time?

00:41:37.231 --> 00:41:38.915
I promise I’ll try.

00:41:40.734 --> 00:41:41.734
Stop crying.

00:41:45.906 --> 00:41:47.063
How about you?

00:41:47.408 --> 00:41:48.493
How’s school?

00:41:50.369 --> 00:41:51.578
It’s fun.

00:41:52.454 --> 00:41:55.332
But it’s way more fun
when you’re with me, of course.

00:41:58.877 --> 00:41:59.946
You know what…

00:42:00.254 --> 00:42:01.438
Mmm?

00:42:01.463 --> 00:42:04.216
…so many girls are
picking on me at school,

00:42:04.675 --> 00:42:09.012
because they know you and
they know you’re my boyfriend.

00:42:09.874 --> 00:42:11.209
Why didn’t you tell me?

00:42:13.725 --> 00:42:15.811
It’s fine with me.

00:42:15.853 --> 00:42:17.325
No problem at all.

00:42:17.350 --> 00:42:18.859
Well, it’s not fine with me.

00:42:19.523 --> 00:42:22.025
Wow, protective, huh?

00:42:22.025 --> 00:42:23.352
That’s new.

00:42:24.403 --> 00:42:26.572
Shut up, Alys, I’m trying
to be a good boyfriend.

00:42:27.114 --> 00:42:28.360
So, stop mocking me.

00:42:30.659 --> 00:42:33.259
“Shut up, Alys, I’m trying
to be a good boyfriend.”

00:42:34.329 --> 00:42:36.039
I said shut up!

00:42:36.891 --> 00:42:37.850
Stop mocking me!

00:42:37.875 --> 00:42:39.665
That’s music to my
ears—say it again!

00:43:04.144 --> 00:43:05.144
Hello?

00:43:05.737 --> 00:43:06.905
[In French] Only you.

00:43:17.998 --> 00:43:18.998
What did he say?

00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:24.634
Well, whatever it
was, I’m still giddy!

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:33.430
Good night, Drakey baby!

00:44:14.252 --> 00:44:15.252
Alys…

00:44:16.091 --> 00:44:17.091
Mmm?

00:44:29.987 --> 00:44:31.345
Should I be worried?

00:44:35.367 --> 00:44:37.369
I won’t let Tripp steal you, Alys.

00:44:38.491 --> 00:44:39.492
Not a chance.

00:44:44.547 --> 00:44:45.547
Where have you been?

00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:47.211
You’ve been gone for so long.

00:44:49.006 --> 00:44:51.383
Uhm, just getting some air.

00:44:51.925 --> 00:44:53.969
Getting some air? For that long?

00:45:00.897 --> 00:45:02.587
Why are you lying, Alys?

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.022
Am I losing you to Tripp?

00:45:05.665 --> 00:45:07.118
Why are you hurting me?

00:45:10.485 --> 00:45:14.006
On the next episode of
Seducing Drake Palma.

00:45:14.031 --> 00:45:16.717
Dane, you’re here!

00:45:16.742 --> 00:45:17.907
What happened to you?

00:45:18.285 --> 00:45:20.306
You are ugly,
but you’re getting even uglier.

00:45:20.787 --> 00:45:22.329
Are you really my sister?

00:45:22.664 --> 00:45:24.791
Good thing I’ve got my
super cute brother here.

00:45:24.791 --> 00:45:25.884
Stop!

00:45:30.881 --> 00:45:32.407
I need to avoid Tripp

00:45:33.216 --> 00:45:35.173
so things will be
peaceful with Drake.

00:45:35.677 --> 00:45:37.571
You’re really avoiding me,
aren’t you?

00:45:38.138 --> 00:45:39.267
What should I do?

00:45:39.598 --> 00:45:43.337
Should I greet him, or just
walk past like I didn’t see him?

00:45:43.935 --> 00:45:45.562
What to do?

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:08.251
Drake!

00:46:08.502 --> 00:46:09.404
Oh no!

00:46:09.429 --> 00:46:11.104
Oh no, this can’t be happening!

00:46:11.129 --> 00:46:12.673
It’s my birthday today!
