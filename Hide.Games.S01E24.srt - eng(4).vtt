00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.320
- What's wrong?
- We found this.

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.120
They say Wang Yu took Wang Mingcheng.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.800
Look at the style and this photo.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.000
Could Wang Yu be avenging Xiao Ran?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:13.880
His revenge isn't over yet.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.160
He lured us here on purpose.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.480
His plan is still in motion.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.400
Nuo and Yasin are in danger.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.420
Yasin.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:59.400
Sorry about this.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.040
I need my niece for a moment.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.480
No, no.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.360
What?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.960
- No.
- I can't hear you.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.920
- Louder.
- No.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.440
No.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.360
Go away.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.920
- Please.
- Or I'll kill her now.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.560
No, no.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.400
What did you say?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.760
Let go.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.040
No!

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:35.560
Sorry, I'm late.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.960
Don't worry.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
Nuo will be fine.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.360
He's after me.

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.080
I never should've let go.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.000
Calm down.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:44.440
- Think.
- I shouldn't have let go.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.600
Did Wang Yu act strangely at all?

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.940
I shouldn't have let go.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.680
Think about it.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.560
The pendant.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.880
The pendant...

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.120
Where is it?

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.960
Look.

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.560
It's not the formula.

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.560
He left it on purpose.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.100
(Where it began is where it ends.)

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:20.110
You wait here.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.960
Look after Yasin.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.080
- I'll pick up Nuo.
- No.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.660
- Let's go together.
- I'll call backup.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.800
No.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.920
We're not sure

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.880
how Wang Yu's doing.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.320
The fewer people there are,
the safer Nuo is.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.860
At least let me go with you.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.680
Alright, you take care of her.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:33.600
Don't worry.

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.280
Hand me the gun.

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.560
Wait for me here.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.680
Be careful.

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:55.680
Dad.

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.560
Dad, help me!

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:59.040
Dad.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.570
Dad, please save me!

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:03.840
Hey, Xu.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.000
Long time no see.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:16.400
I owe you this.

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.480
Tell me.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.660
What do you want from me?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.760
Can you afford that?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:25.880
- No!
- Dad!

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.920
Dad.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.360
Dad, help me!

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.840
- Dad!
- Nuo, don't move!

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.800
I'm here to save you.

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.400
Don't you find

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.360
this familiar?

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.800
We went through the same thing.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.080
Remember?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.760
I begged you the same way.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.400
Remember?

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.000
But you forgot about me.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:47.680
I remember now.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.560
Isn't this what you want?

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.440
Good.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:52.080
Very good.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.960
Pain while aware

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.200
is the truest suffering.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.680
Xu.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.360
You played dumb for two months

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.360
and wasted a lot of my time.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:05.760
This time,

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.560
I'm warning you again.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.840
Don't try any petty tricks.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.280
I won't repeat the mistake

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.280
from two months ago.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.360
But I can feel it.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.160
You've changed.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.160
You asked Boss Jiu to save me.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.360
That means in your heart,

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.040
I'm still your brother.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.160
You're not my brother.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.840
Boss Jiu acted on his own.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.100
I'd rather see you gone.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.040
You know that?

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:38.100
Why go through all the trouble?

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.520
If Wang Mingcheng has Han Xu use drugs,

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760
just let him.

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.320
Why tell me

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.960
to watch over him?

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.880
Our collaboration

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.280
is based on you listening to me, right?

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.680
You're quite interesting,

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.160
scheming to take him down

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:00.680
while wanting me to protect him.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.280
Only I can hurt him.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.500
Wang Mingcheng isn't worthy.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.760
I know what kind of man

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.320
Boss Jiu is.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.360
Why did he save me?

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.680
Han Yu.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.360
Let Nuo go.

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.700
You can do whatever you want to me.

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:21.720
Think about Xiao Ran.

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.520
She wouldn't want you
to hurt the innocent.

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.740
Don't bring up Xiao Ran to me.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.880
Do you really know what kind of man

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.640
she wanted me to be?

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.360
This letter

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.020
is from Xiao Ran to you.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.880
I found it among An Shaocong's things.

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.680
See for yourself.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.340
This really is her handwriting.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.320
Xu.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.960
You know what?

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.520
Before I met you,

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.280
there wasn't a ray of light in my life.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.280
But your appearance

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.440
changed everything.

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:29.930
You were so vulnerable

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.760
but also so resilient.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.840
You were like a faint light,

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.120
making me instinctively want
to protect you.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.640
So, I couldn't allow my light

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.720
to be pulled into darkness
step by step by Wang Mingcheng.

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:45.360
I don't want you
to complete the formula,

00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.520
even if it's for me.

00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:49.760
I don't want you to bear

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.560
the countless sins brought by drugs.

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.680
That's why I risked everything
to contact Officer An

00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:58.280
and told him about the formula.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:00.240
I want to use

00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:02.360
the police's power to save you.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.880
No matter what punishment you face,

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.760
I'll be by your side for a lifetime.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.360
I love you.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.000
Nuo.

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.360
Dad, save me!

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.320
Wang Yu, don't resist.

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:46.080
Xu,

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:48.400
do you remember?

00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:50.880
Back when we were

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.000
in the womb,

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:53.960
you were luckier than I was.

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.080
The arm was yours.

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.520
Everything was yours.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.680
I was abandoned

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.720
and mocked.

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:02.240
I was like a pet

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.160
in that family.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:05.160
Do you know that?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.200
Han Yu...

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800
But it's okay.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:17.800
Look.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.000
Someone still loves me.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.680
I'm not an abandoned pet.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.680
Do you know that?

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.960
Who would have thought

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:45.360
it'd end up like this?

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:49.000
I've moved up recently.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:50.900
You've become the Director?

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:51.880
Congrats.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:53.240
No.

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.680
I mean that place.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.480
Do you need help?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:01.640
Later,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:03.140
I'll introduce you to two people.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.600
Alright.

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.000
Let me say goodbye to him.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.880
Are the new dishes to your taste?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:38.680
You're replacing Wang Mingcheng?

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.440
What do you have

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:42.760
to work with us?

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.040
I killed Wang Mingcheng.

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.440
The formula

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:48.880
is with me now.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.780
Newcomer, don't talk big.

00:10:53.780 --> 00:10:54.960
