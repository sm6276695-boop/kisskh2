00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.840
There's a child downstairs at our place.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.959
Where did you see him?

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.840
You came upstairs again as soon as I looked away.

00:01:42.879 --> 00:01:44.280
You can see this child?

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.159
Of course I can see him.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.439
Slow down.

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:31.960
You're wearing a uniform.

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:34.680
Just got back. Come here.

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.599
This, this should go here.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.919
Are you a caretaker here?

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.120
Yes.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.439
Why did you come back with us?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.680
I...

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:53.520
I want to talk to this child.

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:55.319
He...

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.280
You can try.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:04.800
Hey, little one.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.879
Hello.

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:09.319
What's your name?

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.319
Can I be your friend?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.960
It's no use.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.199
His name is Xiao Tangyuan, he's an orphan.

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:24.680
Since he arrived here,

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.840
he hasn't spoken a word.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.439
So, does he...

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:34.120
There's no problem with his intelligence.

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.240
I've taken him to a psychological clinic for evaluation.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.639
I hope he can live like a normal child.

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:39.759
But his condition

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.439
is more serious than we thought.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.800
You could say right now

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.400
he's completely closed off.

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.000
But

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:49.919
I've found he likes to draw.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.479
He draws what he wants to express.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.400
So I draw with him.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.280
It's a way to communicate, I guess.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:58.240
Watch.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.879
Xiao Tangyuan, can you give it to me?

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:07.240
Give it to me.

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:12.439
Look.

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.800
This is me, and this is you.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.199
I want to be your friend.

00:04:29.279 --> 00:04:30.519
Looks like he likes you.

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.759
Can I stay here a bit longer?

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:39.439
Sure.

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.120
You can wait here.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:42.480
I'll go check next door.

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:44.360
I'll be right back.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.120
I'm leaving.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.560
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.879
It's late, we need to lock up.

00:05:18.519 --> 00:05:19.439
I'll walk you out.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.519
Take it easy.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:37.319
This is far enough.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:39.000
I can take a taxi myself.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.240
The road's under construction, cars can't get in.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.079
Go to the intersection up ahead.

00:05:43.399 --> 00:05:44.120
You can get a taxi there.

00:05:45.399 --> 00:05:46.600
Okay, thank you.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.600
Wait.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.879
Let me walk you there.

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.680
No need, I can go myself.

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.199
It's not safe. Come on.

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:05.839
By the way,

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.759
I still don't know your name.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.279
Yuan You.

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:13.800
Yuan You.

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.279
Can I get your contact info?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.959
Why?

00:06:20.319 --> 00:06:22.040
I want to visit Xiao Tangyuan again.

00:06:23.959 --> 00:06:24.680
That's not necessary.

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.480
I've seen plenty of people like you.

00:06:27.759 --> 00:06:29.399
They get all sentimental at the orphanage,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.680
take a photo, post it on Weibo,

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:33.439
just for the memory, and that's it.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:36.240
After a few days, they lose interest.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240
And never come back.

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:38.160
Instead of that,

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:40.360
it's better not to leave an impression on the child at all.

00:06:41.639 --> 00:06:42.879
If you really don't come back,

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:45.079
the child won't be disappointed.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.199
I won't.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.439
I truly want to spend more time

00:06:48.519 --> 00:06:49.879
and get to know Xiao Tangyuan.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:02.959
Here's my number.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.199
If I come again,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.560
just call this.

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:07.959
Thank you.

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.920
It's just ahead, we'll be there soon.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.079
I feel like someone is following us.

00:07:58.959 --> 00:07:59.439
Yuan You.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.160
It's not about you.

00:08:44.039 --> 00:08:44.679
Boss

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:54.840
Stop!

00:08:59.919 --> 00:09:00.559
Yuan You

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:38.360
Are you sure you don't want to go to the hospital?

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.000
No need.

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.600
The person who attacked you has been following us since we left the orphanage.

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.960
He's been following us, right?

00:09:55.759 --> 00:09:57.039
Who is he, anyway?

00:09:57.919 --> 00:09:58.840
Do you know him?

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.679
Thank you for bringing me back.

00:10:06.279 --> 00:10:07.720
Sorry to trouble you to call another taxi.

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:10.480
Don't worry.

00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.240
No one will follow you anymore.

00:10:26.639 --> 00:10:27.600
Door unlocked.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.039
Where did you go?

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.399
I went to see Dr. Xu today.

00:10:51.279 --> 00:10:52.360
Were you there all day?

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.039
I called you, but you didn't answer.

00:10:57.039 --> 00:10:58.200
I've told you before,

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.240
before you go anywhere,

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.200
you need to let me know.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.799
After all, you're still recovering.

00:11:04.759 --> 00:11:06.960
Sorry, I didn't hear it.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:11.519
Actually, I should be the one apologizing.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:14.480
I really couldn't get out of today's dinner.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.919
Next time, I'll go with you to the doctor.

00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.279
Okay.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:21.759
Get some rest.

00:11:29.559 --> 00:11:30.159
Lu Ming.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.799
What are you doing?

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.879
I brought you some fruit.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.279
Didn't I tell you before?

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.519
Don't come into my studio.

00:11:47.679 --> 00:11:49.519
The air is bad down here.

00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:56.679
Thanks.

00:12:21.679 --> 00:12:22.639
Door unlocked.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.240
Little car.

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.720
Little car.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:36.480
Beep beep beep.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.879
Beep beep beep.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.919
Drive over here.

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:43.559
Drive over here.

00:12:43.919 --> 00:12:45.399
Drive over there.

00:12:45.799 --> 00:12:48.039
Drive over there.

00:12:48.279 --> 00:12:49.879
Little baby.

00:12:51.759 --> 00:12:52.519
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:12:52.919 --> 00:12:54.559
Be the driver.

00:12:55.039 --> 00:12:56.519
Take mom.

00:12:57.879 --> 00:12:58.639
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.840
Go to work.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.120
Go to work.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.120
Are you drawing?

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.840
Can I see your drawing?

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:10.360
Looking at picture books.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.840
Looking at picture books.

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:15.039
Open your eyes wide.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.639
Open your eyes wide.

00:13:41.519 --> 00:13:43.679
Who are you? Why are you here?

00:13:44.399 --> 00:13:45.039
Me.

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:47.639
Are you looking for someone?

00:13:48.279 --> 00:13:49.639
You can't just come in here.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.120
Why are you here again?

00:13:59.559 --> 00:14:00.799
I go to that clinic often.

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.639
Xiao Tangyuan's condition is congenital.

00:14:02.919 --> 00:14:03.679
There's not much that can be done.

00:14:04.519 --> 00:14:06.440
Dr. Xu is the best doctor there.

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:09.559
Xiao Tangyuan probably hasn't met him yet.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.000
Why are you helping him?

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:19.279
I want to communicate with Xiao Tangyuan.

00:14:20.679 --> 00:14:21.759
Because of his drawings.

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:23.120
Drawings.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.519
Xiao Tangyuan drew a girl.

00:14:28.639 --> 00:14:32.080
Maybe in my dreams,

00:14:33.519 --> 00:14:34.360
I've seen her.

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.080
I know it sounds a bit strange.

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.159
Yes.

00:14:46.679 --> 00:14:47.600
It is pretty strange.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:53.919
Let's just do it for Xiao Tangyuan.

00:15:07.879 --> 00:15:09.320
Come here, Xiao Tangyuan.

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:19.720
Xiao Tangyuan's condition

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.759
is one of the more common types of pervasive developmental disorder.

00:15:22.039 --> 00:15:23.000
It's quite common.

00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.960
The cause is still unclear.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.799
It may be related to genetics and infections.

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:30.279
Patients can't communicate normally with others.

00:15:30.679 --> 00:15:32.799
But that doesn't mean they're unaware of the outside world.

00:15:32.919 --> 00:15:33.679
They still have perception.

00:15:34.399 --> 00:15:35.759
So they express themselves in other ways.

00:15:36.120 --> 00:15:38.000
To communicate what they want to say.

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:41.240
For example, through drawing.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.360
So, Dr. Xu,

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.200
can Xiao Tangyuan be cured?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:50.600
Right now, this condition can't be fully cured.

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.480
But some patients

00:15:52.799 --> 00:15:54.279
can improve through rehabilitation training.

00:15:54.559 --> 00:15:55.639
It helps them get better.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.120
Ms. Xu,

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.480
what is your relationship with Xiao Tangyuan?

00:16:05.720 --> 00:16:07.759
Xiao Tangyuan is my friend's child.

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:12.519
Xiao Tangyuan.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.879
Can you show me your drawing?

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:36.639
Dr. Xu

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:39.799
What does it look like to you?

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.960
Maybe a flower, or something else.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.519
The way Xiao Tangyuan experiences the world

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:54.279
is different from ours.

00:16:55.399 --> 00:16:57.559
Sometimes he notices things

00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:59.159
that we usually overlook.

00:17:04.759 --> 00:17:05.319
Xu Xin

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:07.519
Lu Ming

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:09.240
How did you know I was here?

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:11.039
Dr. Xu called me.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.440
So I came.

00:17:14.359 --> 00:17:14.960
What's wrong?

00:17:16.359 --> 00:17:17.480
Are you feeling unwell?

00:17:19.519 --> 00:17:20.559
I'll tell you when we get home.

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.000
Who is this?

00:17:26.759 --> 00:17:27.480
I am...

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.440
Never mind, who I am doesn't matter.

00:17:31.039 --> 00:17:31.920
I'm here for him.

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:35.599
Your husband?

00:17:40.519 --> 00:17:41.960
Xiao Tangyuan, let's go.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.039
Don't waste your energy.

00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.279
Xiao Tangyuan's condition

00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:48.079
can't be solved just by changing doctors.

00:18:01.039 --> 00:18:01.680
Lu Ming

00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.960
Can you go home first?

00:18:04.799 --> 00:18:06.680
Can I take a walk alone?

00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:14.559
Little girl

00:18:15.039 --> 00:18:15.559
Give it a try.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:17.920
Here, take two and try them.

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:18.680
No, thank you.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.359
Try it.

00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.279
Try it, have some fun.

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.319
Here you go.

00:18:34.079 --> 00:18:34.759
Thank you, sir.

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:38.319
Xixi

00:18:41.599 --> 00:18:42.319
Xu Xin

00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.519
This isn't a dream, is it?

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.480
How many years has it been since we last met?

00:18:53.559 --> 00:18:55.079
It's been several years.

00:18:56.359 --> 00:18:58.960
Actually, I've called you many times before.

00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.079
But I could never reach you.

00:19:02.759 --> 00:19:04.359
I changed my phone number.

00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:06.920
Sorry, I didn't tell you.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:12.000
Are you still dancing now?

00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.839
Lu Ming doesn't let me dance anymore.

00:19:14.839 --> 00:19:16.240
He said I was injured.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.640
He's afraid I'll get hurt again.

00:19:19.559 --> 00:19:21.279
But how did you end up in a car accident?

00:19:21.759 --> 00:19:22.960
How is your recovery going?

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:27.240
I've lost a lot of memories.

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:30.759
There are many things I can't remember clearly.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:32.839
That's not good.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.039
If you can't remember much,

00:19:35.039 --> 00:19:36.160
won't it be easy to get tricked?

00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.799
Be careful, don't trust anyone too easily.

00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.519
Okay, I understand.

00:19:44.039 --> 00:19:46.839
Did you forget about me too?

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.079
Of course not.

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:50.880
Our time in college

00:19:51.599 --> 00:19:53.720
was the best time of my life.

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:55.720
There's no way I'd forget that.

00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:57.880
Now you have my number.

00:19:58.039 --> 00:19:59.519
Let's keep in touch from now on.

00:20:01.519 --> 00:20:02.240
Definitely.

00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:10.960
Do you still remember Xixi?

00:20:12.839 --> 00:20:13.960
Why bring her up all of a sudden?

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:17.079
At the night market today,

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.680
I ran into her while you were busy.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:21.640
I even chatted with her for a bit.

00:20:29.160 --> 00:20:31.000
How much do you still remember about her?

00:20:36.039 --> 00:20:37.400
I just remember she had bad luck with people.

00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:39.880
And she's a bit wary of men.

00:20:45.519 --> 00:20:46.240
So she...

00:20:46.519 --> 00:20:47.359
I'm a bit tired.

00:20:49.359 --> 00:20:50.200
Let's talk tomorrow.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.240
Hello

00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:48.839
Xu Xin saw Xixi today.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:39.599
Do you remember?

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:42.279
We're meeting Teacher Zhong today.

00:22:43.559 --> 00:22:44.599
Teacher Zhong.

00:22:47.039 --> 00:22:47.640
That's right.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.359
We haven't seen each other much since graduation.

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:57.640
We arranged this a few days ago.

00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:22.920
Let's go.

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:43.839
Lu Ming, Xu Xin, it's been a long time.

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.960
Teacher Zhong, it's been a while.

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.480
Come in.

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:04.759
Xiaoya.

00:24:05.599 --> 00:24:06.799
My two students are here.

00:24:18.039 --> 00:24:20.640
Teacher Zhong, your home is beautiful.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.920
It's all thanks to Xiaoya.

00:24:23.839 --> 00:24:25.759
She designed everything here.

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.720
Seeing you both so happy now,

00:24:30.119 --> 00:24:31.000
puts my mind at ease.

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:34.680
Teacher Zhong.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.599
You and your wife are happy too.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:42.200
Xiaoya majored in the same field as you.

00:24:42.599 --> 00:24:43.480
She dances too.

00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:47.240
Which university did your wife graduate from?

00:24:47.839 --> 00:24:48.640
Same as you.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.160
She graduated from Yingzhi University.

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:52.599
She was three years behind you.

00:24:53.759 --> 00:24:56.079
Xiaoya and I started dating after she graduated.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.200
Do you still dance now?

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.640
I haven't danced in a long time.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.119
Lu Ming, Xu Xin.

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.519
Stay for dinner later.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.599
Try Xiaoya's cooking.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:29.880
Help yourselves.

00:25:30.839 --> 00:25:31.359
Give it a taste.

00:25:38.799 --> 00:25:40.519
Your wife's cooking is really delicious.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.559
She learned it all after we got married.

00:25:43.279 --> 00:25:44.240
Teacher Zhong always says,

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:45.839
If you can't win a man's stomach,

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:47.880
you can't win his heart.

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.839
I remember the first time I met Xiaoya,

00:25:53.319 --> 00:25:55.480
I went to see her perform Swan Lake.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:58.319
Back then, my eyes

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.240
were glued to her.

00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.279
Even now.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.920
At that time,

00:26:07.079 --> 00:26:08.079
she hadn't graduated yet, right?

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:16.359
That's right.

00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:18.079
Since then,

00:26:18.519 --> 00:26:21.519
I've admired her ever since.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.200
Alright, Teacher Zhong, that's enough.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:25.759
It's getting a bit cheesy.

00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.920
You still call him Teacher Zhong.

00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.359
Just like before.

00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:42.839
That's nice.

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.079
Teacher Zhong

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.119
Lu Ming asked you

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.319
how you bought the painting in the guest room.

00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.480
Then I have a great place to recommend to him.

00:27:47.039 --> 00:27:48.279
You like Marquez too?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:53.240
Teacher Zhong recommended this to me.

00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:55.680
But I prefer that other one,

00:27:56.920 --> 00:27:58.319
"Love in the Time of Cholera."

00:28:00.279 --> 00:28:01.640
After reading it, I realized

00:28:02.599 --> 00:28:06.119
there is such pure

00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:08.720
and unwavering love in this world.

00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:11.880
It changed me.

00:28:15.799 --> 00:28:16.920
Have you read this book too?

00:28:18.599 --> 00:28:19.839
When I was in college,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.000
he recommended it to me as well.

00:29:14.559 --> 00:29:15.400
What's wrong, Xu Xin?

00:29:16.319 --> 00:29:17.799
You still seem unsettled.

00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.039
It's nothing.

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.000
Lu Ming.

00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:23.559
That day...

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:26.599
When I was by the washing machine,

00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.839
why did you suddenly show up next to me?

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.319
I was working in the studio.

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.200
I heard something and came up.

00:29:36.599 --> 00:29:38.119
I saw you standing there, lost in thought.

00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.160
Is there a problem?

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.359
Were you alone in the studio?

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.160
I like working late at night.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.119
After you go to sleep,

00:29:48.839 --> 00:29:49.920
I always go there alone.

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.119
Did you forget?

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.880
But that day,

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.200
I saw a yellow raincoat in the washing machine.

00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.279
Why did it disappear later?

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.359
There was no such clothing.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.960
I saw it.

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.680
There was blood on that raincoat.

00:30:09.039 --> 00:30:10.279
I've told you many times,

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:12.319
there was never anything in the washing machine,

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:13.599
especially not a bloodstained raincoat.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:15.160
I really saw it.

00:30:15.759 --> 00:30:17.279
It was that girl's blood.

00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:18.920
She...

00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.799
She was killed.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:23.759
Stop talking.

00:30:27.359 --> 00:30:28.640
That's all in your imagination.

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.200
But I really saw it.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.079
No buts.

00:30:36.079 --> 00:30:36.599
Xu Xin.

00:30:37.799 --> 00:30:38.799
Dr. Xu said

00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.720
your brain suffered memory loss from the car accident.

00:30:42.319 --> 00:30:43.960
It's normal to have some memory confusion.

00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.039
That's perfectly normal.

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.680
Please don't be like this anymore.

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:33.200
What's wrong, Xu Xin?

00:31:35.519 --> 00:31:36.079
What's wrong?

00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:39.240
What's wrong?

00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.279
It's nothing.

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:49.519
It's fine.
