feeling guilty

00:09:09.666 --> 00:09:10.466
after

00:09:11.066 --> 00:09:11.866

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:13.933
I'm avoiding my friend.

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:15.066

I am taking revenge on him.

00:09:38.966 --> 00:09:41.200
I don't know what kind of friend I am.

00:09:42.666 --> 00:09:43.600
Ma'am, you look like a friend.

00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:45.333
That's not a friend anymore.

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:49.666

I thought I would be happy.

the debut

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.666
I'm sorry because Jake has agreed to be

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.900
my escort

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:12.133
but why does it seem like

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:13.333
I am not very happy.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.700
Is it because Trip doesn't pay attention to me anymore?

00:11:21.266 --> 00:11:23.200
What a mess life is.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:33.800

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.700
Are you and Felice not walking?

00:11:42.466 --> 00:11:43.900

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.400
hmm

00:11:52.166 --> 00:11:53.200
What's up with you?

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:54.466
You're ugly.

00:11:54.566 --> 00:11:55.733
You are getting uglier.

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.533

00:12:00.666 --> 00:12:01.566

This is terrible.

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:13.666
Just flirting.

00:12:14.733 --> 00:12:17.200
If you act like this, it's like you're not my sister.

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.200
It doesn't seem like it really is.

00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:22.333

00:12:38.933 --> 00:12:40.800

00:13:33.366 --> 00:13:34.166

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:43.900
It's not pretty.

00:13:44.466 --> 00:13:45.266

00:13:46.966 --> 00:13:47.766

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.066
Is it beautiful?

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.066
Is it okay with me?

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:52.666
your boyfriend

00:13:52.666 --> 00:13:53.466

You are still close to me.

00:14:26.733 --> 00:14:28.333

nana keeps on scolding

00:15:20.133 --> 00:15:22.166
me just because i talk to a lot of girls at school

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:24.766
it's not my fault if they think i'm being flirty

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:25.900
i'm just being friendly

00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:26.800

00:15:36.533 --> 00:15:36.966
too much

00:15:36.966 --> 00:15:38.333
I am lucky to have my family.

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:40.166
thank you lord

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:41.400
for giving me the best

00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.000
Who did I inherit from?

00:15:44.966 --> 00:15:47.533
Mommy, I just picked it up from the trash.

00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.700
spoke

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:50.666
my sister

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.066
Hey, why are you reading that?

00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:10.666
that's a magazine for adults

00:16:11.566 --> 00:16:12.366
so

00:16:13.866 --> 00:16:14.666
so

00:16:14.666 --> 00:16:16.000
really kids now

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:19.500
alice

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:24.900
do you believe

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:27.333
the number of girls i played with

00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.900
would be the amount of times

00:16:28.966 --> 00:16:30.300
you would cry because of someone

00:16:35.366 --> 00:16:36.566
Why should I cry?

00:16:37.366 --> 00:16:38.866
Have you cried a lot?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.700
i don't know

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:43.366
but if that

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:44.533
theory is true

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.600
i think you need to embrace yourself

00:16:51.933 --> 00:16:52.933
i'll sleep in your room

00:16:53.333 --> 00:16:54.933
hmm why in my room?

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:56.466
Sleep in your room.

00:16:57.300 --> 00:16:58.366
i don't like it there

00:17:00.133 --> 00:17:00.900
anyway

00:17:00.900 --> 00:17:01.900
Where are you from here?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.600
it's better now

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:04.466
You sleep there.

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:07.866
theory

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.700
What if it's true?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.200
today too

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:15.866
Who are the people who made you cry?

00:17:19.333 --> 00:17:20.200
It's been a while.

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:44.300
That's terrible.

00:17:44.366 --> 00:17:46.133
Why do you have a secret?

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.000
I didn't expect it because I always go to SCA.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.933
yes, of course not

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:51.900
I'm sorry, bro.

00:17:52.466 --> 00:17:53.533
our first time passing by

00:17:53.666 --> 00:17:54.466
but of course we don't

00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:56.366
We will miss this day that we don't have you.

00:17:56.466 --> 00:17:57.266
surprised

00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.100

Well, of course.

00:18:06.766 --> 00:18:08.900
It was only school that separated us, right?

00:18:08.966 --> 00:18:10.066
but we are still friends

00:18:13.933 --> 00:18:14.900

I thought you were going with them.

00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.066
My class is later, in an hour.

00:19:17.166 --> 00:19:18.133

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:19.566
Okay, thank you.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:20.966
Do you want to eat at the café?

00:19:21.866 --> 00:19:22.666
you are free

00:19:23.333 --> 00:19:25.133
Is it my birthday? I'm still going to have fun.

00:19:25.166 --> 00:19:25.966
Oh, okay?

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:26.866

00:19:28.266 --> 00:19:29.666
Of course, I've only been here once.

00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:40.300

00:19:40.566 --> 00:19:41.366

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.766
It's free, yes.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.533
Maybe I have to pay for this.

00:19:47.333 --> 00:19:48.166
okay later

00:19:48.966 --> 00:19:50.266
Happy birthday again Alice

thank you shin

00:19:52.466 --> 00:19:54.333
It's still early, I'm so happy.

00:19:56.166 --> 00:19:57.800
Are you ready for your party later?

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.100
ahmm

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.566
yes, a little nervous

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.166
just because

00:20:02.166 --> 00:20:03.600
Mommy invited a lot of people.

00:20:03.733 --> 00:20:04.533
whole family

00:20:04.533 --> 00:20:05.333
we think

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:06.866
of course it's included

00:20:06.966 --> 00:20:07.766
my friends

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.866
and then maybe even the children of friends

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:10.766
mommy and daddy's

00:20:10.766 --> 00:20:11.566
also invited

00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:13.666
The venue will really be full later.

00:20:14.866 --> 00:20:15.500
you know

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.066
I miss your mischief.

00:20:17.133 --> 00:20:17.933
surplus

00:20:18.166 --> 00:20:19.533
I miss you too, Shin.

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:21.266
data

00:20:21.600 --> 00:20:24.333
I feel so excited when Shin smiles at me.

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:26.000
but now

00:20:26.733 --> 00:20:27.333
genuinely

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:29.300
I'm only happy when he smiles.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.700
How are you doing in Brentford?

00:20:33.566 --> 00:20:35.000
You must be happy, right?

00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:37.533
Have you adjusted yet?

00:20:38.566 --> 00:20:39.366
line up

00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.200
I am still very sad.

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:42.166
because almost

00:20:42.166 --> 00:20:43.500
The first semester is halfway through.

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:45.000
I still don't have any friends.

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:48.066
Do they hate me so much just because I'm their girlfriend?

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:49.000
me and drake

00:20:51.733 --> 00:20:52.533
today

00:20:52.566 --> 00:20:53.666
Alice hmm

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:55.866
I said

00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:57.800
How are you doing in Brentford?

00:20:58.466 --> 00:20:59.333
Are you happy?

00:21:00.933 --> 00:21:02.066
This is okay.

00:21:02.366 --> 00:21:03.300
I am happy.

00:21:04.866 --> 00:21:06.900
You know, it's a shame I'm not at sea.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.700
We understand their verse.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.600
kent it

00:21:09.933 --> 00:21:11.366
but it's good to know

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.733
Are you happy here?

00:21:13.933 --> 00:21:14.766
you are shin

00:21:14.966 --> 00:21:15.400

00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:15.866

00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:18.133
love life

00:21:18.133 --> 00:21:19.366
What is that love life?

00:21:19.366 --> 00:21:20.500
I don't know about love life.

00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:21.500
Hey, it's been a while.

00:21:21.600 --> 00:21:22.366
since he left

00:21:22.366 --> 00:21:22.933
why are you

00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:23.333
move on

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:24.466
move on when you have time

00:21:24.766 --> 00:21:26.733
mm I moved on, huh?

00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:27.766
why do you know if

00:21:28.266 --> 00:21:29.200
I was able to move on.

00:21:29.333 --> 00:21:30.133
no

00:21:30.166 --> 00:21:31.700
I'm just a third wheel to Aya and Ken.

00:21:32.066 --> 00:21:32.566
but happy

00:21:32.566 --> 00:21:33.166
that's right

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:33.900
you know

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:35.766
Those two are both naughty, hmm

00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:38.133
What is that?

00:21:38.266 --> 00:21:39.066
third wheel

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:41.133
hmm

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.666
I'll just ask my playboy brother later.

00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.900
the meaning of the third wheel

00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:47.700
is

00:21:47.766 --> 00:21:48.333
go away

00:21:48.333 --> 00:21:49.133
just a puzzle ha

00:21:49.466 --> 00:21:51.400
I need to leave, okay?

00:21:52.566 --> 00:21:53.866
Why is it sold out?

00:21:54.166 --> 00:21:55.266
You're done eating.

00:21:55.666 --> 00:21:57.066
Do you have worms in your stomach?

00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.500
Time flies, so see you later, okay?

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:00.400
happy birthday again

00:22:00.733 --> 00:22:01.533
See you later.

00:22:01.933 --> 00:22:02.900
thank you babye

00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:03.900

00:22:09.066 --> 00:22:09.800
even if I say

00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:10.900
Are you okay?

00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.900

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200
but don't worry best friend

00:22:16.066 --> 00:22:16.966

00:22:17.166 --> 00:22:17.966
everything

00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.500
Okay, what should I do?

00:22:35.966 --> 00:22:37.366
Should I greet him or not?

00:22:37.533 --> 00:22:39.300
I'll just go straight as if I didn't see anything.

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.366
what happened

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:52.400

00:22:52.466 --> 00:22:53.133

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:53.933
nothing

00:22:59.733 --> 00:23:02.100
Is he that angry that I'm avoiding him?

00:23:04.766 --> 00:23:05.766
This is difficult.

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.266
I miss them already.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.266
before refrigeration

00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:30.500
existed

00:23:31.666 --> 00:23:33.333
Did the fool really forget?

00:23:33.466 --> 00:23:34.566
That is my existence.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.133

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:37.933

by the way

00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.066
The Spanish have not arrived yet.

00:23:44.266 --> 00:23:45.133
our ancestors

00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:46.700
already knew

00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:48.133
how to preserve food

00:23:57.066 --> 00:23:57.866
this trip

00:23:58.966 --> 00:24:01.400

Maybe he left my birthday gift.
