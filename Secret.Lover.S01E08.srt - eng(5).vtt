00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:02.360
You're moving in with Tuo?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.590
Yes.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.570
Uncle decided to sell the house
and move to Kaohsiung,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.260
but Tuo wants to stay here,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:19.940
so Uncle told him
to take care of things himself.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.380
I see.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.660
The company where I'm interning

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.960
is too far from home,

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:30.580
and commuting between school and work

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.100
takes up so much time.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.680
We can't get proper sleep,

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.990
so we often doze off in class.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.540
That's why I thought

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.290
Tuo and I could live together

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.540
and find a place
which is convenient for both of us.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.180
The internship is just temporary.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.030
Just bear with it, and it'll be over soon.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.870
Honey.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.440
It takes three hours round trip every day.
Could you bear with that?

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.880
It takes that long?

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:54.980
Yes, Dad.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.330
Besides, you always say

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.480
Tuo is more independent and mature,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.210
so I could learn from him
if I moved in with him.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.440
Yushu left,

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.860
and now even Junxi wants to move out.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.470
Yushu left home
because he had a fight with you,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.550
but now Junxi is discussing this with you.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.150
The situation's completely different,
okay?

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.860
Alright, alright. I agree.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.640
Thanks, Dad.

you...

Tuo.

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.110

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.230
Long time no see.

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.060
Are you really moving back home?

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.270
Well,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.600
I had some bad luck.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.090
The braised food shop went under
because of the pandemic,

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.560
and I've had trouble
finding jobs since then.

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.360
I'm three months behind on rent,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.770
and now

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.530
the landlord has kicked me out.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.870
What about your wife?

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.800
We're divorced.

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.840
A month ago.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.900
I can only count on you now, Junxi.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.510
Please help me take care of Xiaozhou.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.740
Look,

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:57.890
his clothes, snacks,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.320
toys, dishes, everything's here.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.450
Just help me take care of him for one day

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.290
so I can go back
and have a proper talk with Dad.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.550
If you take Xiaozhou with you
to talk to Dad,

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.720
he might be more reasonable.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.980
We just moved in ourselves,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:10.770
and we haven't even unpacked yet.

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:12.590
You know Dad's temper.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.350
What if he tries to hit me?

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.570
What's more important, my dignity

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.100
or unpacking your stuff?

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:21.380
I know you're the best.

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.750
Talk to Dad properly then.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.900
Don't argue.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.670
These are the signature braised dishes
of my shop.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.930
Just help yourselves.

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:37.760
It's not good.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.020
Don't eat it.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:41.490
Xiaozhou!

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.610
Alright, that's it for today's class.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.510
Yushu will surely get a good beating

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.550
from Uncle this time now that he's back.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:52.480
That's exactly what he was worried about,

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.710
so he asked Junxi
to take care of Xiaozhou.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.270
Xiaoyang, are you ready?

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.400
Busy bee, want to grab dinner together?

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.130
I need to go back
and help Junxi look after the kid.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.560
A kid?

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.550
Who did Junxi have the kid with?

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:08.200
It's his nephew.

Help him more
with taking care of Xiaozhou.

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.160
What do you mean?

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.590
Xiaozhou.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.600
That's Uncle Tuo's ruler, not a toy.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.570
I don't care.

Walk slowly.

He's truly an angel when asleep,
but a little devil when awake.

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.170
Say thank you to Uncles

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.300
for taking care of you yesterday.
It was hard work.

00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.600
That's not true. I was good and brave.

00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.670
I slept by myself at night.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.230
Unlike Uncles,
who slept hugging each other.

00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.120
I let Xiaozhou sleep in my room yesterday.

00:14:35.330 --> 00:14:37.590
You could have just slept with Xiaozhou.

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.240
Why did you go sleep with Tuo?

00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:43.390
So you two

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:45.410
have that kind of relationship?

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:50.620
You're overthinking it.

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:52.020
We're just friends.

00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:00.640
I see.

00:15:04.450 --> 00:15:05.850
Well, we're leaving now.

00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:08.460
Goodbye, Uncle. Goodbye, Uncle Tuo.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:09.110
Bye-bye.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.430
Goodbye.

00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:12.090
Alright, let's go.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.120
We're going to see Grandpa and Grandma.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.360
We're leaving.

00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.090

00:15:22.130 --> 00:15:22.900
Bye.

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.780
Yushu didn't figure it out, did he?

00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:32.510
No, he didn't.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.280
You two have been living together
for almost a month

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.240
and only now thought to invite us over?

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.540
Everyone's been busy,

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.130
and you two have busy schedules, too.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:57.930
It's alright. Celebrating one month
of living together is nice too.

00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.520
Junxi, how did Uncle and Auntie
agree to this?

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:07.890
Well...

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.850
Don't tell me you told your family

00:16:11.870 --> 00:16:15.530
you're just roommates,
learning to be independent or something?

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:19.680
No way! I got it right?

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:21.510
Out of ten couples who live together,

00:16:21.510 --> 00:16:22.510
nine use that exact excuse...

00:16:22.510 --> 00:16:23.330
-He Youmei!
-So old--

00:16:23.330 --> 00:16:24.260
Old-Fashioned.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.440
Just eat your fried chicken.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:28.330
I'll go get some beers.

00:17:17.089 --> 00:17:18.150
Don't mind He Youmei.

00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:19.680
She always talks like this.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:26.280
What's wrong?

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:29.940
Nothing.

00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:33.280
You want me to tell you everything,

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:34.550
but what about you?

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.100
You never tell me anything.

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:37.920
I don't have anything to tell.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.580
Weren't you being bullied
at your internship?

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.150
Did Xiaoyang tell you that?

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:51.380
Was that a message
from your company just now?

00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.000
[You and Tuo are dating, aren't you?]

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:23.050
I'm so hungry.

00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:24.880
It ended before I had my fill.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.730
You're the one to blame,
for talking improperly.

00:18:28.730 --> 00:18:30.600
You ruined the party.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.040
I didn't.

00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.820
They just felt guilty themselves.
It wasn't my fault.

00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.180
By secretly dating like this,

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:38.930
they're just leaving a backup plan
for their relationship.

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:41.860
They're not deliberately
trying to keep it a secret.

00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:43.960
Who knows?

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:47.030
This kind of secrecy always
leads to trouble.

00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:49.020
I'm talking from my experience.

00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.990
If you don't believe me,
just wait and see.

00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:56.230
Love that can't be spoken aloud
won't survive challenges.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.750
It's like ice cream—

00:18:58.530 --> 00:19:00.820
under the sun, it melts in an instant,

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:03.440
leaving nothing.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.790
He Youmei.

00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.250
Did something happen to you before?

00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.810
Scared you, didn't I?

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:19.700
I just read all this in comics.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.240
I'm starving. Let's go get some ramen.

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:24.230
I don't like lying.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:27.110
If it hurts, it hurts.
If you want to cry, cry.

00:19:27.210 --> 00:19:30.140
Smiling and saying you're fine
doesn't make it true.

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.650
If I say it hurts,

00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:34.300
would you blow on it for me?

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.890
Blow on it?

00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:39.320
Like this.

00:19:57.220 --> 00:19:58.620
Blowing on it won't help.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:01.320
If you don't face the wound,

00:20:01.350 --> 00:20:03.190
it won't disappear or heal.

00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.910
No matter how many times you blow on it,
it will still hurt.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.770
If you keep acting like this, be careful—
I might fall for you.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:14.350
You little fool.

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.900
Which ramen place do you want to go to?

00:20:23.650 --> 00:20:25.020
The internet café.

00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:27.570
Are you crying?

00:20:27.670 --> 00:20:28.770
No, I'm not.

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:30.480
He Youmei, you crybaby.

00:20:30.530 --> 00:20:31.000
I'm not.

No, it's not.

Yes, it is.

that I fell asleep
playing games in your room
