[Shadow Love]

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.950
[Episode 29]

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.370
I was about to ask you the same.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.900
That day when Shuang and Jin'an

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.600
were going to die together,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.740
why did you step in to help them?

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.330
I never thought

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.310
that love

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.110
could really make people risk their lives.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.650
Watching them face death so bravely,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.290
I suddenly felt

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.380
that perhaps helping lovers be together

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.750
was also a kind of healing.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.900
You always talk like

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.670
you don't care about it at all,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.590
but when it really mattered,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.050
you didn't just walk away.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.270
Thank you for saving them.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.910
And thank you

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.550
for letting me realize
who I treasure most.

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:14.530
You all mean too much to me.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:17.050
I can't let go.

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:19.560
So,

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.480
I probably won't be able
to join your sect.

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.430
Does "you all"

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:28.020
include me?

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:34.910
In a few days,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.660
everyone will return to Lucheng.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.550
There's still a long road ahead.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.360
We'll meet again if fate allows.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:26.510
Pour the wine.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.920
Your Majesty,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.360
too much wine is bad for your health.

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240
Please take care of your health.

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:51.510
You may all leave.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.720
Your Majesty,

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:00.690
you're drunk.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.570
If I could really get drunk,

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.500
that would be nice.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.190
How are the preparations?

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.550
An elite unit of the Imperial Guards
is already outside the east gate,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.880
awaiting your command.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:25.120
Go to Wuling Mountain,

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.070
surround it with the Imperial Guards,

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:30.330
and wait for Li Shuang.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.200
Is Your Majesty concerned

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.950
that General Li might disobey your order
and never return?

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:35.740
But the Li family and the Changfeng Army…

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:37.400
Even the most upright person,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.060
once a knife is at their throat,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.120
will throw aside loyalty,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:43.760
honor, and filial duty.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.460
Compared with one's own gain or loss,

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:48.840
the lives of others

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.530
mean nothing at all.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.510
Selfishness

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.500
is human nature.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.120
I understand.

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:57.300
And Jin'an—

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.060
he was once the man in black,

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:02.910
involved in too many things.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:04.240
Bring him along as well.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.970
Bring him back alive if possible.

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:07.500
If not, bring his body back.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.040
As you command.

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.190
I won't let them have their way.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.220
I will never let go

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:24.620
of what belongs to me.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:35.480
Master is recovering in seclusion

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.360
and cannot see you off.

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.650
He asked us to escort
the three of you down the mountain.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.250
Thank you.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.630
Master also asked me

00:06:40.630 --> 00:06:42.090
to give you this medicine.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:44.240
Although your wounds have healed,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.090
you still need plenty of rest.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.210
Take it regularly,

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.070
and it will greatly benefit you.

00:06:50.159 --> 00:06:51.890
I don't dare take his medicine.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.000
First it's shadow puppets,
then it's light puppets.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.400
One thing after another.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.700
Thank you all for your help
during this time.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.500
We'll meet again if fate allows.

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.960
There's nothing
between your master and me.

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.160
We're not in a relationship.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.480
He is a perfect gentleman,

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.840
and I'm not pregnant.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.560
Stop spreading rumors

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.520
so he won't be troubled needlessly.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:13.200
And this—

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:15.590
please give it to him.

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.970
Tell him

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.630
he and I are even from now on.

00:07:24.570 --> 00:07:25.250
Let's go.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.310
Did she really say that?

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:47.150
Yes.

00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.120
Master, is there anything else
I can do for you?

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.000
Nothing else.

00:07:57.570 --> 00:07:58.210
You may go.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.080
Loving someone means…

00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:08.200
sharing good food,

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.750
enjoying beautiful scenery together,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.800
wanting to share all the wonders
in the world with them,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.260
and being willing
to bear each other's pain.

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.870
Why are you sighing?

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:42.750
Shuang,

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.590
this is as far as I'll go with you.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.130
You're not going back to Lucheng?

00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:52.240
Going back to watch you two
being all lovey-dovey

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.390
while I'm all alone?

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:54.480
In your dreams.

00:08:55.670 --> 00:08:58.240
I'm staying here
to continue studying medicine.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.540
Even though the clinic is gone,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.520
I can still become a renowned physician

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:03.090
and help those who need me.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200
I can tell

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.060
that during the time on Wuling Mountain,

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.960
you've been really happy.

00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:19.680
You are free.

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:21.050
From now on,

00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:23.290
you can do
anything you want.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:28.920
After we part today,

00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:32.110
we might not see each other again
for a long time.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.910
No matter where we are,

00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:34.200
you must write to me.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.650
Even if we're not together,

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.650
our hearts will always be together.

00:09:59.430 --> 00:10:00.500
And you,

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.140
treat Shuang well.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.720
If you ever hurt her,

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.910
no matter how far I have to go,

00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:06.240
I'll make you pay for it.

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:41.620
Didn't you go down the mountain with them?

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:43.520
Why are you back?

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.410
I never said I was leaving.

00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.960
Besides, I can't bear to leave you.

00:10:51.130 --> 00:10:52.790
I mean, your Wuling Mountain.

00:10:56.390 --> 00:10:58.190
There are so many rare medicines

00:10:58.870 --> 00:11:00.200
and medical books here.

00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.150
I haven't learned them all yet.

00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:04.080
Wouldn't it be a shame to leave now?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.970
What do you take this place for?

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:12.230
You think you can come

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:13.800
and go as you please?

00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:18.200
You were moved by Shuang and Jin'an,

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.510
and you helped them.

00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.020
That means you're not cold-blooded.

00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:27.320
So now that I've returned

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.910
after leaving,

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.390
aren't you quite happy?

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.790
I seem to recall someone saying

00:11:33.990 --> 00:11:35.580
we're even from now on.

00:11:37.390 --> 00:11:38.630
I've already cleared your name

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.150
in front of everyone.

00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:42.230
Don't push your luck.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.910
I haven't even given you
a piece of my mind yet!

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:48.110
You didn't even come out to say goodbye.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.500
Heartless as ever.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:57.320
You haven't even become my disciple,

00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:01.810
yet you already dare
talk back to your master?

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.930
So you agree?

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.320
Staying on Wuling Mountain isn't easy.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.840
Whether you can pass the test

00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:11.200
depends on

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.550
your talent.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.320
And here,

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.600
take this.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.840
I never take back

00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.960
what I gave away.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:34.870
Master!

00:12:35.250 --> 00:12:36.610
Wait for me, Master!

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:41.720
[Wuling Mountain]

00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:42.320
See?

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:43.480
I told you

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:46.390
Lu Xin couldn't bear
to leave Wuling Mountain.

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:47.870
I won

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:48.630
our bet.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.360
Though Mo Yin is eccentric,

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:53.900
he's a man of integrity.

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.240
With him by Lu Xin's side,

00:12:56.810 --> 00:12:58.210
I can rest easy.

00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.580
Where did everyone go?

00:13:07.030 --> 00:13:08.090
Why is nobody here?

00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:10.390
The fire is still burning.

00:13:10.390 --> 00:13:11.920
Could they have gone hunting?

00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.670
The Changfeng Army
is strictly disciplined.

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:14.600
Without orders,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.410
they wouldn't act on their own.

00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.550
General Li has been away
from the capital for days with no word.

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.850
His Majesty misses you greatly

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.070
and has ordered me to escort you

00:13:30.100 --> 00:13:31.950
and Mr. Jin'an back to the capital.

00:13:31.950 --> 00:13:34.140
Being emperor really changes a person.

00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:35.400
But do you really think

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:37.080
you and your men can stop us?

00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:38.710
Move.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:44.000
General Li left her post
on an imperial mission.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.060
It's totally fine.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.490
But as border guards,

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:47.630
they abandoned their posts.

00:13:47.630 --> 00:13:49.480
It's a crime punishable
by execution of their entire families.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.150
I'm merely following orders.

00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.790
If you cooperate, General,

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:55.000
I'll ensure the safety of your men.

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.210
By the way,

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:00.240
your father and brother

00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:02.200
are waiting for you in the capital.

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.190
General,

00:14:05.490 --> 00:14:06.240
shall we?

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:18.200
[Imperial Palace of Taijin]

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.640
[Imperial Study]

00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:36.930
Your Majesty,

00:14:37.030 --> 00:14:38.180
I have fulfilled my mission.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.600
Jin'an, Li Shuang, and her subordinates

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.790
have all been escorted
back to the capital.

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:42.670
The two of them are now
waiting outside the palace

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.270
for Your Majesty's summons.

00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:46.030
This was no easy task.

00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.520
I didn't expect it to go so smoothly.

00:14:49.050 --> 00:14:49.850
Your Majesty,

00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:51.980
General Li is concerned
about her family's safety,

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.480
so she naturally complied.

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:54.390
As for Jin'an,

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:55.440
I've learned

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:57.440
that his extraordinary strength

00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:00.430
came from a sacred relic
of Wuling Mountain in his body.

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:02.520
Now that the relic has been returned,

00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:04.740
he's nothing more than a common warrior,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.800
completely at Your Majesty's mercy.

00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.940
The man in black was
once unmatched in bravery.

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:13.570
What a pity.

00:15:15.150 --> 00:15:16.000
Recently,

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.800
the Yao State has expressed
the wish for peace.

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:21.000
Their envoy entered the city yesterday

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.270
and will

00:15:22.490 --> 00:15:23.820
seek an audience today.

00:15:25.150 --> 00:15:26.510
During the late emperor's reign,

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:28.030
they provoked us repeatedly

00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:30.160
and never showed any desire for peace.

00:15:30.390 --> 00:15:32.840
Why the sudden change of heart?

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.480
The transition of imperial power

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:37.550
is indeed

00:15:37.550 --> 00:15:40.550
the best opportunity
to shift from enemies to allies.

00:15:41.130 --> 00:15:42.800
But my rule is not yet steady.

00:15:43.550 --> 00:15:44.720
I fear

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.520
their peace offering is merely a pretense,

00:15:47.670 --> 00:15:50.080
and their real aim is
to test our strength.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.440
Let my order be known:

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:07.210
a banquet will be held in the palace

00:16:07.210 --> 00:16:09.210
to entertain the Yao State's envoy.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.630
Li Shuang and Jin'an are to

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:14.850
attend as well.

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:19.510
General Li has defended the border
for years,

00:16:19.510 --> 00:16:21.480
fighting the Yao State time and again.
She ought to be there.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.070
But Jin'an...

00:16:22.070 --> 00:16:24.470
He once dealt the Yao State
a crushing blow.

00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.900
How could I exclude him

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.600
from such an occasion?

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:29.480
Besides,

00:16:30.880 --> 00:16:32.540
he once did me a great service.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.190
As the Emperor now,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:37.200
I should reward him.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.040
Yes, Your Majesty.

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:02.840
Summon the envoy of the Yao State.

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.170
[Xianyang Palace]

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:25.240
I'm Bai Kun, envoy of the Yao State.

00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.510
On behalf of our Empress Dowager
and Sovereign,

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:31.070
I congratulate Taijin's new emperor
for his ascension to the throne.

00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:33.270
Since you've come to our court,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.440
why do you not kneel before His Majesty?

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:38.080
I came to Taijin

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:41.950
under the command of the Yao State's
Empress Dowager and Sovereign

00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.200
to seek peaceful coexistence
between our two states.

00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.830
There is no reason
for me
to bow and call myself your subject.

00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:48.790
Sir, you're being so aggressive.

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.580
Does this mean

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:54.490
your court's desire for peace
is not sincere?

00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.940
Mr. Bai, you are mistaken.

00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:04.160
If you can help facilitate a peace treaty,

00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.440
it'd fulfill the wish
of the people of both states.

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:10.780
The Changfeng Army has guarded
the border for many years,

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.440
and this is all we seek as well.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.340
The envoy has traveled from afar.

00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:20.160
It must have been a tiring journey.

00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:21.020
But since we are

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.870
still in national mourning,

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:25.160
it's not proper to hold a lavish feast.

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:26.920
So today,

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:29.040
I've arranged a simple banquet

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:30.890
to welcome you.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.230
I have long heard of
General Li Shuang's unmatched bravery.

00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:50.230
Seeing you today,

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.610
I can see that the rumors are true.

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.760
However, Taijin is actually

00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.710
relying on a woman to defend its borders.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:02.510
Is there truly no man in your court

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.590
more capable than her?

00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:11.660
In Taijin, we employ people

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.420
regardless of gender.

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:16.520
There may be differences in rank,

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.270
but there is no difference in loyalty.

00:19:19.650 --> 00:19:20.410
Besides,

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.750
haven't all your elite generals

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.900
been defeated by me, a woman?

00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:35.480
Your Majesty,

00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:37.310
I have come not only

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:38.880
to pay my respects

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.150
but also to deliver a peace treaty.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.590
To show our sincerity,

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.260
we have only 2 conditions.

00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.660
First,

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:49.680
return the captured soldiers
of the Yao State.

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:50.960
Second…

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:58.870
Disband the Changfeng Army.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:16.290
If Your Majesty agrees,

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:17.920
our state is willing to cede 2 cities:

00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.120
Qingchuan and Helan.

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.340
From then on, the two states
shall never go to war again

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.140
and will remain allies forever.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:31.210
General Li,

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.030
what do you think?

00:20:36.690 --> 00:20:37.490
Your Majesty,

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.700
the Changfeng Army

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:41.660
is one of Taijin's most important
defense forces.

00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:46.030
How can it be disbanded just because of
the words of a scheming envoy?

00:20:47.730 --> 00:20:49.730
Actually, when all is said and done,

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:52.290
it's because the battles were so brutal

00:20:52.470 --> 00:20:54.510
that your emperor became wary.

00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:00.690
But since both states have decided

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:02.590
to make peace,

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.330
making a compromise

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:05.570
is not impossible.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.120
Besides, now that peace reigns
throughout the land

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.650
and the borders are stable,

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.410
it's time for General Li
to lay down your armor

00:21:13.410 --> 00:21:15.140
and return home to get married.

00:21:17.200 --> 00:21:18.400
When that time comes,

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:20.910
if the envoy visits Taijin again,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.130
she and I

00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:26.610
will prepare wine to welcome you,

00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:28.020
and we can catch up

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.280
as old friends.

00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:31.780
General Li,

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:33.280
don't you agree?

00:21:45.550 --> 00:21:47.070
Your Majesty is right.

00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:48.790
If so,

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.400
leave the maps of Qingchuan and Helan.

00:21:52.790 --> 00:21:54.390
As for the other conditions,

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.580
we'll discuss them later.

00:21:56.830 --> 00:21:57.640
Your Majesty,

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:01.780
do you mean to seize two cities
without giving anything in return?

00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.850
As the ruler of a state,

00:22:04.330 --> 00:22:06.190
how could you go back on your word?

00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.920
Watch your mouth!

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:09.550
How dare you be so insolent

00:22:09.550 --> 00:22:10.880
and insult His Majesty?

00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:13.160
Though the Yao State desires peace,

00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:15.420
we are not weaklings to be trampled upon.

00:22:18.550 --> 00:22:20.610
If Your Majesty has no wish for peace,

00:22:20.650 --> 00:22:22.410
we do not fear war.

00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.270
When blood runs in rivers,

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.180
all the officials here

00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:28.420
will bear witness.

00:22:45.070 --> 00:22:46.530
Sir, you must be mistaken.

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.550
If His Majesty wished to reject peace,

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.980
he wouldn't have arranged this banquet.

00:22:56.030 --> 00:22:56.760
It was merely

00:22:57.270 --> 00:22:59.460
a test of your state's sincerity.

00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:16.550
Your Majesty,

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:17.880
allow me to speak

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.720
on the envoy's behalf.

00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.460
Taijin and the Yao State have fought
dozens of battles.

00:23:23.460 --> 00:23:25.020
Countless soldiers died,

00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:26.640
and the people at the border

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:27.570
were displaced.

00:23:27.790 --> 00:23:30.970
What they've longed for
all their lives
is nothing but peace.

00:23:30.970 --> 00:23:31.830
If the two states

00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:33.070
could cease fighting,

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.730
it would be a blessing for all.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.880
Please, Your Majesty,

00:23:35.880 --> 00:23:37.480
cast off the old, begin anew,

00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.830
and bring a fresh start for the people.

00:23:41.790 --> 00:23:44.050
The Changfeng Army cannot be disbanded.

00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:45.580
However, if your state

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:47.370
cedes 2 cities as you offered,

00:23:47.370 --> 00:23:48.500
half of the captives

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.400
can be released.

00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:54.570
Envoy,
what do you think?

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:01.200
Half of the captives

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.750
for 2 cities?

00:24:05.030 --> 00:24:05.830
Your Majesty,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:08.390
don't you find that greedy?

00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:12.490
Greedy?

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.260
As the defeated nation, the Yao State

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.250
should have expected harsh terms.

00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.550
Now,

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:23.510
the advantage lies with Taijin.

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.120
I choose peace or war as I please.

00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:30.940
I am the ruler of the world.

00:24:31.960 --> 00:24:33.200
Whatever I desire,

00:24:33.650 --> 00:24:34.900
I shall have.

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:47.660
I am a guard under General Li.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.240
It's my honor
to be summoned by Your Majesty,

00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.130
and I believe

00:24:51.870 --> 00:24:53.670
there's a special reason for it.

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:55.320
No need to be modest.

00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.680
Back in Lucheng,

00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:00.660
you helped General Li greatly.

00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:03.620
I summoned you to give you a reward.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:07.430
My humble efforts deserve no credit.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:08.680
However,

00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.310
since Your Majesty has offered,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.510
there is one thing

00:25:12.090 --> 00:25:13.480
I'd like to request.

00:25:33.790 --> 00:25:34.790
I beg Your Majesty

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:36.450
to grant me a marriage.

00:25:43.700 --> 00:25:45.350
Since you've asked,

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:47.880
I shall make arrangements.

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:48.680
But

00:25:49.950 --> 00:25:52.480
you may have to wait
until after I get married.

00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.740
I've already agreed with General Li—

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:02.600
the Changfeng Army's commander,
General of the North, Li Shuang,

00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:04.530
will resign from her military post

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:06.760
and enter the palace as my consort.

00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:40.420
Yunjing is truly extraordinary.

00:26:41.510 --> 00:26:42.350
I've finally

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.000
seen these green tiles and red walls.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.840
This is where you grew up.

00:26:53.790 --> 00:26:55.310
I know you're upset.

00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:57.310
Instead of bottling it up,

00:26:58.070 --> 00:26:58.720
why not just…

00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.920
Why should I be upset?

00:27:02.070 --> 00:27:03.120
Do you really think

00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:05.490
I'm the biggest fool in the world?

00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:09.050
If I still couldn't understand you by now,

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.470
how could I say I love you?

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:19.910
If I'm angry at anything,

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.240
it's that

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:24.660
you didn't

00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.480
tell me sooner.

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:34.540
It must've been hard

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:36.800
to endure all this alone
for so long.

00:27:48.730 --> 00:27:50.390
It really has been a long time.

00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.000
To save me,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.530
you've suffered so much.

00:27:57.370 --> 00:27:59.300
Leave everything to me from now on.

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:00.850
We'll face

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.280
whatever comes our way.

00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.690
The only thing that matters is—

00:28:07.350 --> 00:28:08.160
you are

00:28:09.070 --> 00:28:10.600
my wife for life.

00:28:12.570 --> 00:28:13.900
That will never change.

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:23.510
I know

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:27.870
my words must be very touching.

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:30.700
But could you please

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.110
not cry all over my clothes?

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.770
If you're so fussy about tears and snot,

00:28:41.770 --> 00:28:44.070
how are we going
to spend a lifetime together?

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.350
Normally, it's fine,

00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:47.950
but I'm about to meet my father-in-law.

00:28:47.990 --> 00:28:49.720
I can't show up looking sloppy.

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:52.900
Without our parents' consent

00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:54.690
or a matchmaker's proposal,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:55.690
you can't call him

00:28:55.890 --> 00:28:57.290
your father-in-law yet.

00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:01.530
That's not true.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:05.760
With my charming demeanor,

00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:08.210
once your father meets me,

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:11.030
he won't be able to say no.

00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:20.190
Sorry, Father,

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.550
I let you down.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.710
I'm glad you're safe.

00:29:34.510 --> 00:29:35.110
Father,

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:38.920
this is the one I told you about—

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.070
Jin'an.

00:29:42.640 --> 00:29:43.270
Come here.

00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:51.590
It's your honor

00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:52.620
to meet me.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:58.960
It's my honor

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.000
to meet you.

00:30:05.410 --> 00:30:06.280
Shuang!

00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.440
Shuang!

00:30:09.030 --> 00:30:10.630
I finally caught up with you!

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.880
You left in such a hurry last time.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:15.380
I quit my studies and rushed back,

00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:16.820
but I still missed you.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:18.940
I heard that after I left Lucheng,

00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:20.670
there were a few more tough battles.

00:30:20.670 --> 00:30:21.630
How have you been?

00:30:21.630 --> 00:30:22.630
Were you injured?

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.310
Here I am, safe and sound,

00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:26.020
standing right before you.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.640
It's you.

00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:34.360
Not done staying
at the General's Residence,

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:36.090
so you followed her to Yunjing?

00:30:36.790 --> 00:30:37.590
Young Master,

00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.160
were we

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.500
very close before?

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.270
We only had some
small disagreements before.

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.290
Do you really have to pretend
you don't know me?

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:46.620
That's not what I meant.

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:49.050
I had a bit of an accident.

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:50.400
I don't remember much

00:30:50.850 --> 00:30:52.450
of what happened in the past.

00:30:54.870 --> 00:30:55.870
Quit pretending.

00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:58.430
He just recovered from an injury.

00:30:58.430 --> 00:30:59.560
Don't mess with him.

00:31:01.030 --> 00:31:03.450
Y-You're favoring your lover
over your own brother.

00:31:03.450 --> 00:31:04.070
Ting.

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:06.680
Quan.

00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:07.340
Yes.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.350
Prepare a guest room for…

00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:12.980
our guest.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.180
Yes.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.160
You put your lover before your brother.

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160
Keep your voice down. Keep it down!

00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.750
Look at you, wearing a flower and a dress.

00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:23.350
Get out. Get out.

00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:24.400
Stop talking nonsense. Go out.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:25.920
Fine, I'll have the kitchen
prepare some food for you.

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.110
Go now, go.

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:48.040
What's wrong?

00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:52.240
I can feel

00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.580
that I was close to Young Master
back in Lucheng,

00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:57.780
but I can't remember a thing.

00:31:58.220 --> 00:32:00.220
I knew I'd gradually forget things,

00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:03.240
but I didn't expect it to happen so fast

00:32:03.670 --> 00:32:04.730
and so completely.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:10.000
Then let it be forgotten.

00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:12.100
As long as you still remember me,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.010
I'll tell you about the past.

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:19.310
Back on Wuling Mountain, you told me

00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.830
that we should not dwell on the past,

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.680
that every hill and field
would be our witness.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:26.760
Does that not count anymore?

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.310
You're right.

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.480
Instead of dwelling on the past,

00:32:36.530 --> 00:32:38.260
we should cherish the present.

00:32:39.030 --> 00:32:40.960
We still have a long journey ahead.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:56.700
Your Highness,

00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.590
without His Majesty's permission,

00:32:57.590 --> 00:32:58.590
you cannot enter.

00:33:00.530 --> 00:33:02.210
I'd like to see

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:04.050
who dares to stop me today.

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.840
My beloved concubine,
you've grown bolder and bolder.

00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:28.990
Now, when you see me,

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:31.820
you don't even show
the most basic courtesy.

00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.680
Concubine?

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:38.890
No wonder the coronation
keeps being delayed.

00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:41.070
So you really plan
to deprive me of my position,

00:33:41.070 --> 00:33:41.880
marry Li Shuang,

00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:43.080
and make her empress?

00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:45.230
You are my lawful wife.

00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:48.110
It's only right

00:33:48.170 --> 00:33:49.380
for you to be empress.

00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.350
What's gotten into you today?

00:33:52.350 --> 00:33:53.630
Where is this coming from?

00:33:53.630 --> 00:33:55.190
Stop pretending.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.900
Don't think I don't know

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.740
what you said in front of
all the officials and the envoy

00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.030
at the banquet today.

00:34:00.600 --> 00:34:02.800
You've only been emperor for a few days,

00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.680
and you're already getting carried away.

00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:05.480
Don't forget

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:07.070
whose support kept you alive

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.600
so you could sit here today.

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:12.070
Who is so audacious

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.190
as to sow discord between us

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:17.420
and speak recklessly of state affairs?

00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:18.920
I will

00:34:19.429 --> 00:34:20.889
punish them immediately.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.989
It was me.

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:27.969
Father!

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.920
Your Majesty, have you decided

00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:39.110
how you'll punish me?

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.480
Father,

00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:41.070
today, he...

00:34:41.070 --> 00:34:42.630
Go back and rest.

00:34:42.750 --> 00:34:45.350
I have a few words to say
to my son-in-law.

00:34:45.760 --> 00:34:46.400
But I...

00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.420
Go back first.

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:03.480
We are family,

00:35:04.110 --> 00:35:05.920
so I called you my son-in-law.

00:35:06.510 --> 00:35:08.400
Please don't take offense.

00:35:12.450 --> 00:35:14.050
I wouldn't, Father-in-law.

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:15.550
If I hadn't

00:35:16.340 --> 00:35:17.420
taken this seat,

00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.520
the one sitting on the throne

00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.810
should have been you.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:25.360
I am old now.

00:35:25.830 --> 00:35:28.180
I wouldn't dare covet the throne.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:30.630
However,

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.010
many royal relatives

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.870
are constantly scheming,

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:37.480
and there are rumors in court

00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:39.480
saying Your Majesty is incompetent

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:41.210
and unworthy of this position.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:43.110
Because of this,

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:45.440
I've worked tirelessly

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:47.700
to keep them in check and maintain order.

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:49.640
Father-in-law,

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.850
please speak frankly.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.260
Tian Huailiang
from the Ministry of Personnel

00:35:58.260 --> 00:36:01.100
has impeached Jia Shihong,
the governor of Jiuqing County,

00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.300
for embezzling disaster relief funds,

00:36:03.510 --> 00:36:05.630
which I'm sure
Your Majesty is already aware of.

00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:07.150
His wife

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:09.150
is my cousin.

00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:11.760
Since she is my relative,

00:36:12.030 --> 00:36:14.110
she is also Your Majesty's relative.

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.250
Family shares honor and disgrace.

00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:17.440
Surely

00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:19.560
Your Majesty understands that.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:25.330
I have already ordered

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.660
a thorough investigation
into Jia Shihong's case.

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.930
This man is a complete parasite.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:33.380
Even if I wanted to help,

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.600
I'm afraid there's nothing I can do.

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:40.840
So…

00:36:43.630 --> 00:36:45.800
Your Majesty means to refuse me?

00:36:47.070 --> 00:36:49.230
Do you think Tian Huailiang
is

00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:52.180
truly acting out of loyalty?

00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:55.350
He once served Prince Li.

00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:56.880
He is using this

00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:59.320
as an opportunity to slander me

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.970
and force Your Majesty
to cut off your own arm.

00:37:05.950 --> 00:37:07.990
Have you already forgotten

00:37:08.610 --> 00:37:11.130
how you once came to me

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.910
begging and pleading?

00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:16.950
If I hadn't fought
to put you on the throne,

00:37:18.150 --> 00:37:20.860
Your Majesty wouldn't even have the chance

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.560
to refuse to help me

00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.580
with a minor corruption case.

00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:35.880
If I

00:37:36.110 --> 00:37:38.170
had the power to put you on the throne,

00:37:39.990 --> 00:37:42.630
I have the power to drag you down.

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.670
I will forever be

00:38:06.810 --> 00:38:07.340
grateful

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:08.650
for your kindness.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.110
As for Jia Shihong's case,

00:38:11.110 --> 00:38:12.840
you may rest assured.

00:38:14.190 --> 00:38:15.710
As mediocre as you are,

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.220
you should be content being a puppet.

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.480
Even if you're manipulated,

00:38:22.370 --> 00:38:25.370
it's better than desperately fighting
for survival.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.070
As for Your Majesty's jest

00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:35.030
in court today
about General Li,

00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:37.110
I will pretend I never heard it.

00:38:37.710 --> 00:38:39.510
As long as you sit on the throne,

00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.510
Tianjiao must be

00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:43.480
empress.

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:47.770
I

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.290
will heed your guidance, Father-in-law.

00:39:46.210 --> 00:39:47.870
Good morning, Grand General.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.440
You're late.

00:39:55.530 --> 00:39:56.800
Were you waiting for me?

00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.880
Did you come today…

00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:04.320
to tell me something?

00:40:16.090 --> 00:40:17.220
After Li Shuang and I

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.300
met each other,

00:40:18.510 --> 00:40:19.310
we grew close,

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.330
faced hardships together,

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:22.880
and fell in love.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:26.720
I have come specifically

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:30.870
to ask for your daughter,
Li Shuang's hand in marriage.

00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:34.080
I hope you will give us your blessing.

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:41.880
Shuang told me you've suffered greatly

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:43.600
and lost all your supernatural strength.

00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:45.530
I tested you with my sword earlier.

00:40:46.730 --> 00:40:48.990
You only have basic martial skills left.

00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:50.200
If you marry her,

00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:52.660
how will you protect Shuang?

00:40:54.900 --> 00:40:55.630
With my life.

00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.760
You should know

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.110
His Majesty won't let her go easily.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.460
That's why I plan to take Li Shuang

00:41:00.460 --> 00:41:02.590
away from Yunjing as soon as possible.

00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.330
Su Muyang

00:41:03.360 --> 00:41:05.110
fears the power of the Changfeng Army.

00:41:05.110 --> 00:41:06.510
He will not dare harm you.

00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:07.780
What if Shuang refuses?

00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.280
If you don't stand in our way,

00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:10.280
I will find a way to convince her.

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.630
What if I do stand in your way?

00:41:11.630 --> 00:41:13.320
Then I'll keep pestering you
until you don't.
