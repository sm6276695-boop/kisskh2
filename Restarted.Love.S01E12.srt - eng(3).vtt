00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.159
Xu Xin

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:18.400
Come with me for a moment.

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.960
Okay, Teacher.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.960
Xu Xin

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.960
Do you remember that day

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.599
when Teacher Liao came to watch your performance?

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.240
Out of everyone, he noticed you right away.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.000
It's a rare chance to intern with their dance troupe.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.280
If you do well, you could even study abroad.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:34.439
What do you think?

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.120
Teacher Wu

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.719
I might need some time to think about it.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:47.360
Can I give you my answer after I’ve made up my mind?

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:50.919
Then let me know as soon as you decide.

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.960
I heard there’s a great internship opportunity.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.840
But you gave it up.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:00.919
You’ve been dancing for so many years.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.439
Don’t you want to try performing on a bigger stage?

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:04.120
Give it a shot?

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.919
I don’t want to leave school just yet.

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.080
Is it that you don’t want to leave school,

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.199
or is it because you can’t let go

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:12.680
of your new boyfriend?

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.919
Xu Xin

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.039
This is a big decision in your life.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.599
You really need to think it through.

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.199
So you won’t regret it later.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:29.159
Why didn’t you study art?

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.879
I grew up by the sea.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.639
Normally, I should have been like my parents,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.000
and become a fisherman.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:41.639
But you know what?

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.599
From the moment I first picked up a paintbrush,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.319
I felt like I’d found

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:47.520
what I truly love to do.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.000
And I knew I could do it really well.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.840
Just like Matisse.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.680
I’m not that talented.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.439
It’s just that I was supposed to follow my parents’ path

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:58.159
and live that life.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.680
But I drifted further and further away.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.479
What about you?

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.080
I don’t know.

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.560
My mom chose dancing for me.

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:11.639
I was really young back then.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.000
So I didn’t have any opinions.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.720
Training every day was tough,

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.199
but I stuck with it.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:22.920
If you ask me what I like,

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.759
or what I want to do,

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:27.639
I honestly don’t know.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.680
I know.

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.759
You’ll write novels.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.519
Not those online stories,

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.920
but as a real author.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.360
Like that one...

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.279
What’s her name...

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:38.199
Charlotte Brontë.

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.879
Yeah.

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.639
That’s her.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.000
Teacher Zhong

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:46.560
I’ve decided to give up the chance to join the dance troupe.

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.519
Because I’ve found a new goal now.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040
I want to be with the most important person in my life

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.120
and make a future together.

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.680
Finished watching.

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:45.680
All done.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.800
Let me guess.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.439
So was the wife the killer?

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.800
No.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.639
Guess again.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.279
Really? Not her?

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:56.480
Then who else could it be?

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.040
Just kidding.

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.600
You got it right, it was the wife.

00:06:01.319 --> 00:06:02.680
You tricked me!

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.839
Getting clever, huh?

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:08.040
It's getting late.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.839
I should head home.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:10.920
Yeah, it is late.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.720
Why not stay here tonight?

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.000
You know how my mom is.

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:17.439
She's really strict with me.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.240
If I don't go back on time,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.199
she'll call and nag me nonstop.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.160
We've been together for so long.

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:28.720
Should we go visit your mom?

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.240
But my mom,

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:36.680
she's way too strict.

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.439
I'm afraid she might not like you.

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:41.639
Don't worry.

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:43.040
I'll make sure to behave well.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.319
I'll make her like me.

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:47.879
Mom.

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:48.480
Auntie.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.519
Come in, quick.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.519
You young people...

00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.759
Always eating out.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.920
Honestly,

00:06:56.920 --> 00:06:58.000
the food out there isn't clean.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.600
You know that, right?

00:06:58.839 --> 00:06:59.399
So,

00:06:59.399 --> 00:07:00.759
it's rare to have a home-cooked meal.

00:07:00.759 --> 00:07:01.439
Eat more.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.120
This is delicious.

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:04.199
Auntie, you're a great cook.

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.199
Lu, what do you do for work?

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:11.240
Mom.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.160
Lu Ming is an artist.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:16.759
So,

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:17.920
my daughter found herself

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.279
an artist as a boyfriend?

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.199
You're too kind, Auntie.

00:07:23.639 --> 00:07:24.319
I just graduated.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.600
I'm not well-known yet.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800
But I'll work hard.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.800
I'll do my best to give Xu Xin a better life.

00:07:37.240 --> 00:07:37.800
Auntie.

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.920
Xu Xin insisted on washing the dishes herself.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:40.839
She asked me to come keep you company.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:42.800
That's nice.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:43.480
Have a seat.

00:07:43.839 --> 00:07:44.759
Let's have a chat.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.560
Our Xu Xin,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.279
she's studied dance since she was little.

00:07:54.399 --> 00:07:55.480
She's won many awards.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.680
So,

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:01.560
I really hope her future

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.959
will be truly happy,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.480
carefree.

00:08:07.399 --> 00:08:08.319
Auntie, don't worry.

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.800
I'll make sure she's happy.

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.040
I know.

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.360
You already said so just now.

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:18.560
Actually, as a mother,

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:22.600
I want Xu Xin to be happy now,

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.160
not just in the future.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:26.240
Do you understand what I mean?

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.720
Of course.

00:08:31.079 --> 00:08:33.279
I know you two truly care about each other.

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.840
I shouldn't interfere with your relationship.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.759
After all, I was young once too.

00:08:37.759 --> 00:08:38.360
Right?

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.480
It's just...

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:44.240
I hope you don't get too deeply involved.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:48.840
Because when you're together,

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.960
Xu Xin might not get the happiness she deserves.

00:08:52.519 --> 00:08:54.919
Do you get what I'm saying?

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.919
What are you thinking about?

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:16.879
Nothing.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.240
Ever since we left my place,

00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.600
you've seemed down.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.600
Did my mom say something to you?

00:09:24.679 --> 00:09:25.320
No.

00:09:25.879 --> 00:09:27.559
We just chatted about everyday things.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.080
Xu Xin

00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.960
Have you ever regretted being with me?

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.000
How could I regret it, silly?

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.200
You treat me so well.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.440
But right now, I can't

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.559
give you a wealthy life.

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.559
Why worry about that?

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.159
As long as we're together, that's enough.

00:09:51.159 --> 00:09:53.200
And I don't need you to support me.

00:09:54.039 --> 00:09:55.320
We can work hard together.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:10:00.080
Starting tomorrow,

00:10:00.279 --> 00:10:01.759
I'm going to work at a dance studio.

00:10:02.759 --> 00:10:04.519
Even though I can't perform on stage yet,

00:10:04.919 --> 00:10:05.879
I believe

00:10:06.759 --> 00:10:08.120
as long as I keep dancing,

00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.840
one day I'll be back on stage.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:11.879
You definitely will.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.799
Your dancing is the most beautiful I've ever seen.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:19.679
That's more like you.

00:10:19.919 --> 00:10:21.000
Come on, let's go back.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:32.879
Mom.

00:10:34.399 --> 00:10:35.279
Mom, what's wrong?

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:35.960
Xu Xin.

00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.279
Xu Xin, come here!

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:39.759
Come here, come here!

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:41.960
Come here.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.799
Didn't you say you weren't feeling well?

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.000
Let me introduce you.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.039
This is Yu Qiao.

00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.840
This is Yu Qiao's mother, Auntie Wu.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000
And this is our Xin Xin.

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:56.519
Xin Xin,

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.879
I saw you when you were little.

00:10:58.159 --> 00:10:59.200
Now you've grown up.

00:10:59.279 --> 00:11:00.600
You're getting prettier and prettier.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.200
You called me back just for a blind date?

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.519
What else did you think?

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.240
I just talked with Yu Qiao.

00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.840
He studied finance.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.240
He has a high income.

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:14.960
And he's really kind.

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.879
He's got great qualities.

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:16.639
Isn't that right?

00:11:17.679 --> 00:11:19.159
Sorry, Auntie Wu, Yu Qiao.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.960
Sorry to make you come all this way for nothing.

00:11:22.039 --> 00:11:23.639
If there's nothing else, I'll be going.

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:25.879
Xu Xin.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.799
Xu Xin.

00:11:29.159 --> 00:11:29.879
Sorry.

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.240
Auntie Wu, Yu Qiao.

00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:33.639
I already have a boyfriend.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:35.679
I'm really sorry.

00:11:36.679 --> 00:11:37.279
Xu Xin.

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.559
What are you doing?

00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.440
If you dare walk out today,

00:11:42.799 --> 00:11:43.960
don't bother coming back.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.000
Mom.

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:47.480
I want to decide my own relationship.

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.440
You're not a kid anymore.

00:11:48.679 --> 00:11:50.000
Can love put food on the table?

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.159
Please don't pretend to be sick

00:11:52.159 --> 00:11:52.919
to scare me anymore.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.200
I'm leaving.

00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.559
You...

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:02.840
Lu Ming.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.759
In the future, I really want to

00:12:04.759 --> 00:12:05.919
go wherever I want.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:07.960
It'd be best if I could travel around the world.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.559
When we have money in the future,

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.600
I'll definitely take you to travel the world.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:12.799
Really?

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:13.799
Of course.

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.039
I'll help you achieve all your dreams.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.000
Well, I have a lot of dreams.

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.320
I hope

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.039
I can become a star dancer someday.

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.080
I want to be under the spotlight on a big stage.

00:12:28.679 --> 00:12:30.440
I also want to be a mystery novelist.

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.039
I want to write down all the stories I see.

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:38.440
Then in the future,

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:41.320
how about we build a big traditional house?

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:42.720
What?

00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:46.759
And we can get a dog then.

00:12:47.519 --> 00:12:49.000
Raise our kids together with lots of love.

00:12:50.679 --> 00:12:51.799
I think we'll definitely have

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.960
lots and lots of kids.

00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:54.720
Just imagine,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.120
the house will be full of flowers and plants.

00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.480
It might be a hassle to take care of,

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:01.759
but I know you'll love it.

00:13:02.759 --> 00:13:03.840
You love kids so much,

00:13:04.879 --> 00:13:07.000
you'll definitely be a wonderful mother.

00:13:14.279 --> 00:13:14.799
Xu Xin

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.399
You really are a gift from above.

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.960
The best, best, best gift ever.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.360
I’m truly lucky.

00:13:27.919 --> 00:13:28.919
To be with you.

00:13:31.799 --> 00:13:32.720
After meeting you,

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.759
I truly believe in destiny’s plan.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:39.039
I think you must feel the same.

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:44.440
Before,

00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:47.000
I felt like I was

00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:49.279
the most different person in the world.

00:13:52.159 --> 00:13:53.480
But when I’m with you,

00:13:56.879 --> 00:13:57.799
I feel like this world

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.519
is so pure, it’s just the two of us.

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.200
Miss Xu Xin,

00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.519
will you marry me?

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:30.960
Are you serious?

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:34.679
Absolutely sure.

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.519
So, will you marry me?

00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:42.919
I think your plan is great.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.879
So, does that mean you’ll marry me?

00:15:53.039 --> 00:15:53.639
Auntie

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:12.480
Auntie

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:14.639
Are you here to see Xu Xin?

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.039
She’s not here.

00:16:18.919 --> 00:16:20.120
I’m here to see you.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:23.960
Have a seat.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.840
I’ll get some water.

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.320
Please leave Xu Xin.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.399
I’ve told you all along,

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:33.559
I don’t want you two to be together.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.159
I’ve told you many times too.

00:16:38.639 --> 00:16:39.360
Look at you two.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.720
What kind of place are you living in now?

00:16:44.039 --> 00:16:44.679
Auntie,

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.519
This is only temporary.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.120
I’ll rely on my own abilities.

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.600
We’ll move to a better place soon.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.879
How long will that take?

00:16:51.919 --> 00:16:53.399
Can you wait? Can she wait?

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.200
Auntie,

00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:57.240
Xu Xin and I truly love each other.

00:16:57.799 --> 00:16:59.080
I’ll love her for my whole life.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.120
Yes.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:03.759
I believe what you say.

00:17:04.519 --> 00:17:06.200
I’ve seen plenty of kids like you.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:13.720
Here’s a card.

00:17:14.519 --> 00:17:17.000
Consider it support for your career.

00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.960
I can’t accept it.

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.960
Aren’t you going to ask how much is on it?

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.599
It’s not about the money.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.000
I’ll rely on myself.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000
And what do you have?

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.279
She gave up her career for you.

00:17:28.599 --> 00:17:29.920
She gave up the chance to go abroad.

00:17:30.039 --> 00:17:31.119
She’s given up so much.

00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.160
And what did she get in return?

00:17:34.039 --> 00:17:34.559
Auntie,

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.400
Please give me a chance.

00:17:36.599 --> 00:17:37.160
Please.

00:17:38.119 --> 00:17:38.480
Auntie,

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:39.160
Don’t touch me.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.799
I’m begging you, please leave Xu Xin.

00:17:42.799 --> 00:17:43.720
I’m begging you.

00:17:43.799 --> 00:17:44.680
Please, I’m begging you.

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:46.960
Please, just leave our family alone.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:53.759
Please.

00:17:56.319 --> 00:17:57.000
I’m begging you.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.640
I will never leave Xu Xin.

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.720
I’ll never let you two be together, not even if it kills me.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.799
Lu Ming.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.799
Xu Ran.

00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:10.720
It really is you.

00:19:11.799 --> 00:19:12.519
Long time no see.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.480
How many years has it been?

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:14.960
Yeah, no wonder you looked so familiar.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:15.480
It’s been a long time.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.160
Come, have a seat.

00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:17.480
How have you been lately?

00:19:18.359 --> 00:19:19.759
Just busy with work stuff.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.440
I remember after you graduated high school,

00:19:22.519 --> 00:19:23.519
you applied to an art school.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.079
You must be an artist now, right?

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:26.480
Not really.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.920
I just do some creative work.

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.400
You’re being modest.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.039
You were so talented in art back in school.

00:19:32.319 --> 00:19:33.640
And I remember you won a lot of awards.

00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:35.279
I remember the teachers all said

00:19:35.279 --> 00:19:37.000
you’d definitely become a great artist one day.

00:19:37.599 --> 00:19:38.279
Do you remember that?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.400
So many girls at school admired you.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.839
Even I was jealous of you.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.359
So what’s your big project now?

00:19:46.559 --> 00:19:48.720
Just some installation art pieces.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:50.599
Lu Ming.

00:19:50.799 --> 00:19:51.400
As for me,

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.400
I’ve been working on some business lately.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.160
If you ever need anything,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.119
you can always come to me.

00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:56.599
Come on,

00:19:56.599 --> 00:19:57.319
let’s add each other as friends.

00:19:57.839 --> 00:19:58.359
Sure.

00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:00.359
Here.

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:00.960
You scan my code.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:11.920
What did Auntie say?

00:20:15.119 --> 00:20:17.160
My mom said she never wants to talk to me again.

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.839
But I believe

00:20:22.839 --> 00:20:24.640
she’ll accept us in the end.

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.759
Let’s take care of each other from now on, Mr. Lu.

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:41.759
Let’s look after each other from now on.

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.119
Mrs. Lu.

00:21:08.759 --> 00:21:09.319
Boss,

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:12.160
we only sold one painting this month.

00:21:13.079 --> 00:21:13.759
Mr. Lu,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:15.400
let me put it this way.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.240
Your works are too refined for the general public.

00:21:19.599 --> 00:21:21.480
Could you maybe create

00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:23.640
some pieces that are more popular with the public?

00:21:23.759 --> 00:21:25.519
Like realistic portraits of beautiful women,

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:27.920
or maybe some landscapes.

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:30.519
Thanks for your suggestion,

00:21:31.119 --> 00:21:32.720
but I’d like to stick to my own style.

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.160
What do you mean?

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:36.920
Why cancel the art exhibition after promising it?

00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:40.000
It hasn’t even started yet.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:41.279
How do you know it’ll lose money?

00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:43.559
Do you know how much I put into this piece?

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:45.880
I haven’t slept or eaten properly every day.

00:21:46.039 --> 00:21:47.680
I’ve worked so hard on this piece for so long.

00:21:48.079 --> 00:21:48.920
Almost a whole year.

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:49.720
Do you know that?

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.279
Goodbye, everyone.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.920
Goodbye, teacher.

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:25.839
Let's go.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:27.960
Goodbye, teacher. Bye!

00:22:28.559 --> 00:22:30.400
Come on, say goodbye to the teacher.

00:22:42.119 --> 00:22:42.839
Lu Ming.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.839
We’re old classmates.

00:22:45.359 --> 00:22:46.640
I’ll get straight to the point.

00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.279
I’ve seen some of your work.

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.960
I really like it.

00:22:51.519 --> 00:22:54.400
So I suddenly had a great idea.

00:22:55.319 --> 00:22:56.839
I know some business owners.

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.039
They want to invest in

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:01.240
things related to the cultural and art industry.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.039
So I thought,

00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.720
You’re a great artist.

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.240
As your agent,

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.720
I’ll take you to meet them.

00:23:08.279 --> 00:23:09.319
Let them invest in you.

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.519
No, thanks.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.759
I don’t want my work to be too commercialized.

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:13.720
Why not?

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:16.359
My work is my self-expression.

00:23:16.519 --> 00:23:18.559
What matters to me is the creative process.

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.440
If my work becomes commercialized,

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:21.279
I’ll feel uneasy.

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.119
And not free.

00:23:22.759 --> 00:23:23.759
I hope my work

00:23:24.359 --> 00:23:26.400
can be appreciated by those who truly understand it.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:44.319
Xu Xin.

00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:52.680
What happened?

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:53.839
Here’s what happened.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.039
Teacher Xu Xin

00:23:55.039 --> 00:23:56.680
fell while practicing dance today.

00:23:56.799 --> 00:23:58.119
We took her to the hospital.

00:23:58.359 --> 00:24:00.440
The doctor said she injured her bone.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:01.680
She needs a long period of rest.

00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.559
Didn’t I tell you before?

00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.279
You don’t have to work so hard.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.359
I’m fine.

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.440
It’s just that

00:24:11.279 --> 00:24:12.720
for a long time,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.000
I might not be able to dance.

00:24:15.039 --> 00:24:16.960
The doctor said I need to rest well.

00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:18.400
I can’t get too tired.

00:24:18.680 --> 00:24:20.759
Otherwise, it could leave lasting problems.

00:24:23.160 --> 00:24:25.079
If there’s nothing else, I’ll go now.

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:25.759
Thank you.

00:24:34.799 --> 00:24:35.640
It’s all my fault.

00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:37.279
I made you work so hard.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.079
It’s not your fault.

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:41.400
I was just careless myself.

00:24:42.319 --> 00:24:44.279
But lately, I might

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:45.799
not be able to go to work.

00:24:46.119 --> 00:24:47.519
Now’s not the time to talk about that.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:49.200
Just focus on resting.

00:24:49.319 --> 00:24:50.200
Let me take care of you.

00:24:53.839 --> 00:24:54.920
We’re husband and wife.

00:24:55.200 --> 00:24:56.599
I should take good care of you.

00:24:56.759 --> 00:24:58.039
Come on, lift it gently.

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:58.839
Careful.

00:24:59.079 --> 00:24:59.759
Careful.

00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.720
You seem to be recovering well lately.

00:25:18.599 --> 00:25:19.200
Lu Ming.

00:25:19.759 --> 00:25:21.000
Thank you for taking care of me.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.680
And delaying your work.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.960
What are you talking about?

00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.640
We’re husband and wife.

00:25:29.039 --> 00:25:30.160
We should support each other.

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:30.880
And take care of each other.

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:35.279
Once I recover from this injury,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:37.559
I’ll go back to the dance studio.

00:25:38.119 --> 00:25:39.720
Then you can focus on your art.

00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:41.880
Just get better first.

00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:46.960
By the way,

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:49.880
Is our financial situation

00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.000
a bit tight lately?

00:25:52.079 --> 00:25:52.759
Not at all.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:55.279
I just sold a painting today.

00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.440
It sold for quite a lot.

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:57.400
Don’t worry.

00:25:58.039 --> 00:25:58.759
Really?

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.000
That’s great!

00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:03.039
I believe things will keep getting better for us.

00:26:03.880 --> 00:26:04.920
They’ll definitely get better.

00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:06.319
For sure.

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.720
I’ll take this call.

00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:25.480
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:26:27.359 --> 00:26:28.240
Mr. Ma, you’re here.

00:26:28.839 --> 00:26:29.319
Mr. Ma.

00:26:31.559 --> 00:26:33.440
This must be Teacher Lu, right?

00:26:33.799 --> 00:26:34.720
Let me introduce you.

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.640
This is Lu Ming.

00:26:37.279 --> 00:26:38.599
A renowned installation artist.

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.680
He’s also a future world-class master.

00:26:41.039 --> 00:26:41.759
And he’s my classmate.

00:26:42.519 --> 00:26:45.079
And this is the famous Mr. Ma.

00:26:45.559 --> 00:26:47.440
The Warren Buffett of art investment.

00:26:47.759 --> 00:26:49.480
He’s also the most insightful investor.

00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.720
That’s all just reputation.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.559
I simply love art.

00:26:54.519 --> 00:26:55.200
Hello, Mr. Ma.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.559
Teacher Lu.

00:26:58.039 --> 00:26:59.400
I’m glad to meet you.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:05.519
Teacher Lu.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:06.680
Come, have a seat.

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:09.720
What have you been working on lately?

00:27:10.279 --> 00:27:11.519
Recently, I’ve been creating

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:12.519
pieces inspired by personal reflections.

00:27:12.519 --> 00:27:14.319
And exploring the value of emotional details.

00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.559
Installation art, right?

00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.559
Like putting a urinal in a public space?

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:20.000
That kind of thing?

00:27:20.599 --> 00:27:21.279
I get it.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.119
Teacher Lu.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.359
Your work,

00:27:23.359 --> 00:27:24.759
it’s interesting,

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:27.160
but personally,

00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:28.119
I have some thoughts.

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.240
Just take it as feedback.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.559
Go ahead, Mr. Ma.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:33.480
His work

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:36.279
lacks a bit of topicality.

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:38.839
Contemporary art,

00:27:39.039 --> 00:27:41.680
you have to connect it to current social issues.

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.079
That’s how you get people talking.

00:27:44.079 --> 00:27:46.279
Hot topics mean

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.440
controversy.

00:27:50.559 --> 00:27:51.960
Whatever’s trending in society,

00:27:52.559 --> 00:27:53.839
that’s what we create.

00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.400
Whatever people are anxious about,

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.599
we amplify that anxiety.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.440
That’s how you get attention.

00:28:00.759 --> 00:28:02.200
Isn’t that just exploiting public emotion?

00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:12.480
Mr. Ma.

00:28:13.079 --> 00:28:14.279
Eat something, come on.

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.440
No one’s touched it yet.

00:28:16.680 --> 00:28:17.920
Still too young.

00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:19.359
Teacher Lu.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:22.000
Art comes in many different forms.

00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:24.720
You can’t always do that high art that appeals to few.

00:28:25.319 --> 00:28:26.279
What’s the value in that?

00:28:27.519 --> 00:28:28.160
Alright.

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:30.359
If you didn’t like that idea,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.440
we’ll try something else.

00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:33.119
You need something with a hook.

00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.799
For example, in the world,

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.599
the biggest installation art piece.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.119
Or an installation combining East and West.

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:40.880
That way,

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:42.599
you can create your installation in front of everyone.

00:28:43.359 --> 00:28:45.000
Finish your artwork,

00:28:45.559 --> 00:28:46.799
then blow it up.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:48.319
With one explosion,

00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:51.319
it’s all money.

00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:52.960
Mr. Ma.

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:55.039
Didn’t you say you don’t care about money?

00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:00.599
It’s good for young people to have pride.

00:29:00.799 --> 00:29:02.000
But if we really can’t agree,

00:29:02.319 --> 00:29:03.160
the door’s right there.

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:06.599
Mr. Ma.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.279
Lu Ming didn’t mean that.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:09.119
Come on.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:10.480
Lu Ming and I will toast to you.

00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:11.400
Lu Ming.

00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.160
Come on, together.

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:23.440
I’ve always regretted

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:26.839
not being able to travel back to Van Gogh’s era

00:29:27.079 --> 00:29:28.319
and give him some funding.

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.519
So he could freely express his talent.

00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:33.079
So he wouldn’t have died poor.

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:38.680
Come on.

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:42.920
Good thing Van Gogh never met you.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:45.960
If he had met you,

00:29:46.319 --> 00:29:48.160
his sunflowers might've turned into money trees.

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:49.920
and his ear might've been covered in gold.

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:53.079
Get as far away as you can.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:55.920
Mr. Ma.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.720
Please don't mind him.

00:29:57.839 --> 00:29:59.279
I don't know what's up with him today.

00:29:59.279 --> 00:29:59.960
I'll go check on him.

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:00.720
I'll be right back.

00:30:02.599 --> 00:30:03.079
Lu.

00:30:03.559 --> 00:30:04.119
Lu.

00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.039
What are you doing?

00:30:08.359 --> 00:30:08.759
Let's go.

00:30:08.839 --> 00:30:09.519
Come back with me.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:10.799
Apologize to Mr. Ma.

00:30:10.799 --> 00:30:11.880
Why should I apologize to him?

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.440
He's just a businessman pretending to be artistic.

00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.640
He'll ruin art. Shut up.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:15.920
Let me ask you.

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.519
Do you want a normal life,

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:19.079
or do you want the art you pursue?

00:30:19.359 --> 00:30:20.480
If you want a normal life,

00:30:21.079 --> 00:30:22.599
your work isn't art at all.

00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.640
It's just another product in the market.

00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:26.000
And you're just a worker.

00:30:26.319 --> 00:30:27.240
If you want art,

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:28.680
can your living conditions

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.400
really support your art?

00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.960
If an artist sadly passes away,

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.599
their art still lives on.

00:30:37.279 --> 00:30:38.240
I won't compromise.

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:40.119
Lu.

00:30:48.079 --> 00:30:48.640
Lu Ming.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.680
Wait a second.

00:30:54.119 --> 00:30:55.079
I'm pregnant.

00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:16.559
Xu Xin.

00:31:17.279 --> 00:31:18.160
The baby's name—

00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.680
We can decide after they're born.

00:31:20.079 --> 00:31:21.759
Do you have a nickname in mind now?

00:31:44.079 --> 00:31:45.000
Let's call

00:31:45.519 --> 00:31:46.440
them Xiao Tangyuan.
