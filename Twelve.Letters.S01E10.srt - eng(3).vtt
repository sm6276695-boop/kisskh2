Looking for a burial plot
for your parents?

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.039
No, for myself.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.399
Do you have any specific requirements?

00:00:20.839 --> 00:00:23.000
I want the one next to Plot 1-5.

(Fate)

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.200
Xun has nothing to do with Tang's death.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.640
Why is that?

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.239
She thought he had died long ago.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.960
She had been sweeping
Xun's grave for 30 years.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:13.360
How could they have met again

00:02:13.759 --> 00:02:15.240
and ended up in trouble?

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.759
But my dad is alive.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.159
Whose grave was it?

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.960
I was released from prison in 1996.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.400
I asked around among former inmates

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.599
and finally found out
where Xun was serving.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.759
After Xun saw me,

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.639
he asked me for one favor.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.599
He asked me to tell Tang
that he was dead.

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.039
Xun felt

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.919
that it was a waste of time

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.319
for Tang to wait

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.759
for a convict for over a decade.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.479
He'd rather die

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.400
than keep her waiting.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.719
I understood that.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.400
To convince Tang,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.960
Xun made me erect a tombstone.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.120
Do you know if they were close

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.800
to anyone else?

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.319
Xun was an orphan.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.319
He had no family.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:10.719
But Tang had a father named Ye Yibo.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.280
She never mentioned him.

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:19.280
Why would she mention him?

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:22.199
If Xun hadn't protected her back then,

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.000
Ye Yibo would've

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
ruined her quite badly.

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:27.439
That man was a hopeless gambler.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.400
Tang nearly died at his hands

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.360
several times.

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:33.800
Is he still in Pushui?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.159
I wouldn't know.

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.039
Xun said they'd

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.680
severed all ties.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.080
I never saw him again

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.080
in the town after that.

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:46.439
Uncle.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.280
Do you know anything

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.560
about my dad's

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.599
murder case?

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.280
I only learned about it later.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.120
I was still in prison at the time.

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280
That incident changed

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.960
all our fates.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.599
We thought Xun

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:11.560
could escape this disaster

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:15.639
and leave Meiwan with Tang.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.199
But we didn't know

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.680
that an even greater disaster lay ahead.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:37.759
How do I drink this?

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.240
What now?

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.680
There's a fly in it.

00:04:40.959 --> 00:04:41.879
How can I drink this?

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:42.959
You young punks

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:45.480
should be ashamed of yourselves.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.279
Old fool.

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:47.480
Who are you calling a punk?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.839
Let go.

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:48.439
You.

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:49.240
Am I lying?

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:50.399
Am I blind?

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.319
Let go.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.120
You cripple.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.560
Have you lost your mind?

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.680
Are you insane?

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.319
Cripple.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.720
What are you doing?

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.079
Are you crazy?

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.959
Coming through.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:05.000
Help.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.879
They're ruthless.

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:07.920
You hooligan.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.120
Listen up.

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.040
Don't come back here.

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.480
Hello, Qiang.

00:05:13.519 --> 00:05:14.639
Please calm down.

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:16.720
Hitting seniors isn't right.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.959
Who asked you to speak?

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.000
Qiang, I...

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.720
Get lost.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.519
Qiang told you to get lost.

00:05:24.519 --> 00:05:25.399
Get lost.

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:27.199
Get lost.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.600
Those thugs.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.040
Go away.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.600
All of you.

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:34.000
Back off.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.040
Playing with a knife?

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.879
Outrageous.

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.759
Filthy scum.

00:05:40.079 --> 00:05:41.600
How dare you slap me?

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.279
Help us.

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.680
Scum! Trash!

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.959
You're going too far!

00:05:56.079 --> 00:05:56.879
Let's go.

00:05:57.639 --> 00:05:58.399
Get lost.

00:05:58.879 --> 00:05:59.920
Go away.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.279
Hooligans.

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:29.680
Where are you going?

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:31.279
Nowhere.

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:33.199
Why with weapons?

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.839
I followed you here from school.
Think I'm stupid?

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.040
How long do we have to wait?

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.000
Cha.

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:44.560
What do you want then?

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:47.519
Are you going

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:50.160
to kill Bao or get killed by him?

00:06:52.399 --> 00:06:53.720
Go to school. Go to Grandma.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.199
They beat Grandma, you know?

00:06:55.399 --> 00:06:57.000
She's hospitalized.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:58.680
You know?

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.959
You said you'd fix it.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:00.920
What did you do?

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.360
Tell me, Cha.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.000
I'll talk to Bao right now.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.800
About what?

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.600
They hurt Grandma and Zhenzhu.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:12.680
And next time?

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:14.959
They'll hurt Tang and Xin.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.920
Will you tolerate that then, Cha?

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:21.439
Stay if you're scared.

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:22.279
Let's go.

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:24.360
Step aside.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.480
Let me through.

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:27.519
I'll beat them

00:07:27.519 --> 00:07:28.920
until they kneel and apologize.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.000
What's the point?

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.800
Even if he apologizes,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.800
he can come back again.

00:07:38.519 --> 00:07:39.839
Do you plan to kill him?

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.199
Then how are you going to live?

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.319
Murder is a felony.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.720
How will Grandma live?

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:55.680
What about Zhenzhu?

00:07:57.319 --> 00:07:58.199
What about Ye Haitang?

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:05.040
Have you thought of it? Huh?

00:08:07.519 --> 00:08:08.959
Come on, think about it.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.439
I'll avenge

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:14.279
Grandma's suffering.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.879
I'll make things right.

00:08:59.392 --> 00:09:00.320
(Sunshine "Illegal" Store)

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.639
Isn't it the bookstore?

00:09:01.639 --> 00:09:02.759
How did it get destroyed?

00:09:24.639 --> 00:09:25.200
Sir.

00:09:29.279 --> 00:09:30.320
Is this because of me?

00:09:32.679 --> 00:09:33.399
No.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.279
It's not because of you.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:49.279
I'm sorry.

00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.519
Tang, stop cleaning.

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.279
Sorry, sir.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.600
Stop it.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.480
There's broken glass.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.000
I'm sorry.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:04.879
Stop. Listen to me.

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:12.600
We're closing.

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.200
I'm going back home.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.480
I've bought the ticket.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.399
Why are we closing?

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:25.799
It doesn't make money. It's just

00:10:25.799 --> 00:10:27.120
my personal hobby.

00:10:28.679 --> 00:10:29.720
I'll do something else.

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.320
Here.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.240
These are for you. All good books.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.000
Go ahead.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.399
It's because of me. Isn't it?

00:10:38.759 --> 00:10:40.000
I'll tell them

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.120
to come after me.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:42.600
- Tang.
- I'll tell them...

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:43.840
Tang, it's not your fault.

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:44.840
It's not your problem.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:45.720
It's not.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.600
Why should we close the bookstore?

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:49.360
What did we do wrong?

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.159
Why should we close the bookstore?

00:10:55.919 --> 00:10:56.600
Tang.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.799
You did nothing wrong.

00:11:00.519 --> 00:11:01.759
Neither did I.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.279
It's not our fault.

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:09.120
This place is the problem.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.240
I've been so submissive.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:18.120
I never provoked anyone.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.960
Yet they trashed my store.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:28.600
I'm sorry.

00:11:32.039 --> 00:11:33.320
Tang, I can't... I...

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:35.240
I...

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.039
I'm so scared that one day Hu might...

00:11:41.559 --> 00:11:42.480
I can only hide.

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:48.000
But you are different.
Y-You're still young.

00:11:49.279 --> 00:11:50.720
You have all the time

00:11:50.879 --> 00:11:52.000
and opportunities.

00:11:56.679 --> 00:11:57.279
Trust me.

00:11:58.879 --> 00:11:59.679
Tang.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.600
Just study.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:03.960
Give it your all.

00:12:05.799 --> 00:12:07.840
You must get into university

00:12:09.039 --> 00:12:09.720
and leave here.

00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.879
You hear me?

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.200
What do you want?

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.879
Just walking you home.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.120
Walking me home?

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.240
Do you have to be sneaky?

00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:34.840
I'm home.

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:35.879
You can leave.

00:13:36.679 --> 00:13:37.480
Tan Xin.

00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:41.000
Can't we talk?

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.600
Did you ever listen to me?

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.840
Of course I did.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.240
What about the billiard house?

00:13:47.679 --> 00:13:48.720
What were you discussing

00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.879
with those guys yesterday?

00:13:50.399 --> 00:13:52.039
Planning debt collection and fighting?

00:13:52.399 --> 00:13:53.200
Or maybe

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.200
plotting some grander scheme?

00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:55.960
Li Chadong.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.399
Don't you know me?

00:14:03.679 --> 00:14:04.440
No, I don't.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.399
I don't know who you are anymore.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:10.200
Fine.

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.120
Let it be that way.

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:13.240
Just know

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.799
that I'm done with

00:14:14.799 --> 00:14:15.279
those.

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:16.200
Believe me.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.639
You always say that.

00:14:18.519 --> 00:14:19.960
I believed it every time.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:20.720
And now?

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.120
The fact that we're

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.600
standing here discussing this

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.679
is utterly pathetic, Li Chadong.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.240
Why?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.279
Why can't you prove yourself?

00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:40.000
I don't want to argue.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.600
I just need you to believe

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.159
that everything I'm doing now

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:44.919
is for...

00:14:46.039 --> 00:14:46.879
For...

00:14:52.679 --> 00:14:53.519
For what?

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:57.519
For me?

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:04.039
Did I make you this way?

00:15:16.879 --> 00:15:18.600
I've known you since I was 18.

00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:25.120
I knew you had no choice back then.

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:27.559
I didn't care.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.639
I don't care about your background

00:15:34.639 --> 00:15:35.600
or financial status.

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.039
Life is long.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:39.919
I'm willing to start over with you.

00:15:52.919 --> 00:15:53.840
Maybe it's just

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440
not meant to be.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.159
After all these years,

00:16:00.879 --> 00:16:02.600
we're still stuck here.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:09.399
How much longer must I wait?

00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:12.960
Just...

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:15.080
Just give me one more chance.

00:16:18.039 --> 00:16:18.840
I'm done waiting.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:23.960
Tan Xin.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:26.120
Will you come with me?

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:27.240
Let's go somewhere

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.000
right now.

00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:28.679
Where?

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:29.919
Anywhere.

00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.240
And then what?

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:33.519
Bao.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.759
Due to Shen Dashan,

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.400
we're going to starve.

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.240
Nonsense.

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:39.839
Stay put.

00:17:40.119 --> 00:17:40.640
What?

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.000
Who's starving?

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:43.839
Stop playing victim.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.480
Gobbling everything up

00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:46.319
might choke you.

00:17:46.319 --> 00:17:47.799
That's not how it goes.

00:17:48.039 --> 00:17:48.839
We have a lot more

00:17:48.839 --> 00:17:49.799
buddies to feed.

00:17:49.799 --> 00:17:51.079
We also need to eat.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:52.880
Sit down.

00:17:57.640 --> 00:17:58.640
Sit down.

00:18:08.799 --> 00:18:09.640
Relax.

00:18:10.559 --> 00:18:11.880
I'll handle this.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.839
We trust you, sir.

00:18:16.279 --> 00:18:17.119
Bao will fix this.

00:18:17.119 --> 00:18:18.519
No worries here.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.400
To you, Bao.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.039
Bao.

00:18:27.799 --> 00:18:28.400
Bao.

00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:31.039
Bao.

00:18:34.599 --> 00:18:36.240
Whoever comes is a guest.

00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:40.359
Rare visitor.

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:43.799
Bao.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:46.920
Bao.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.400
I came to apologize.

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.640
Please spare me.

00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:56.839
You want me to look up at you?

00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.200
Is this how you beg someone?

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:06.200
Bao.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:07.920
It's tough business.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.599
We give up.

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:12.359
If I've ever offended you before,

00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:14.960
please forgive me.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.759
I apologize to you.

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:18.440
I was wrong.

00:19:19.519 --> 00:19:20.680
You make it sound like

00:19:21.119 --> 00:19:22.759
I did something to you.

00:19:23.599 --> 00:19:25.119
Aren't you still in one piece?

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:26.519
Either let them continue

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:29.279
or name

00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:30.720
your price.

00:19:31.359 --> 00:19:32.839
You think this is about money?

00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:37.400
Then what'll make you spare us?

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:42.160
I do have a way out

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.359
just for you.

00:19:49.079 --> 00:19:50.079
You bought new clothes?

00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:54.039
It's for you.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.440
I knitted this.

00:20:01.559 --> 00:20:02.559
You knitted it?

00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:03.880
But it's my first time.

00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:05.480
So I don't know if the size fits.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:07.240
I know you can

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:08.359
do anything

00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.839
and do it perfectly.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.200
Let me try.

00:20:18.039 --> 00:20:19.400
You wore it wrong.

00:20:24.039 --> 00:20:24.880
Let me fix it.

00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:29.160
Looks like it fits well.

00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.119
It looks great

00:20:30.119 --> 00:20:31.440
and fits perfectly.

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:33.759
And red is my favorite color.

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:39.920
No one's ever knitted me clothes before.

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:45.480
Money... Money can't buy this.

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:48.160
I'll wear it forever.

00:20:58.079 --> 00:20:59.079
Have you decided?

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.319
Completing this job

00:21:01.319 --> 00:21:02.720
is your only way out.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:06.039
Then I won't bother any of you again.

00:21:06.759 --> 00:21:08.200
I always keep my word.

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:10.000
Remember your words.

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:12.960
If things go south,

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:14.960
no one gets out unscathed.

00:21:30.119 --> 00:21:30.920
Cha.

00:21:32.319 --> 00:21:33.119
Cha.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:38.720
Got a light?

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.079
See you tomorrow.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.200
Did he really agree

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.519
to spare us after this job?

00:22:26.279 --> 00:22:28.359
He's not giving us a way out.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:31.960
It's a death trap.

00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:34.480
Cha.

00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.000
You know best what Bao is capable of.

00:22:37.279 --> 00:22:38.480
We can't trust him.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.640
We don't know what we are

00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:41.440
delivering

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:42.319
or to whom.

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:44.079
Something is fishy here.

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.039
Let's call the police, Cha.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.039
Call the police?

00:22:52.039 --> 00:22:53.200
What would we even report?

00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.319
His lackeys

00:22:56.319 --> 00:22:57.480
used to clean up

00:22:57.960 --> 00:22:59.480
his messes.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.160
He's totally clean.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.319
He'll just escalate

00:23:03.319 --> 00:23:04.920
the harassment and torture.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:06.599
Nothing's happened yet.

00:23:06.599 --> 00:23:08.480
It'll be too late if anything happens.

00:23:12.599 --> 00:23:13.920
Do we have to take this job?

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:15.200
Can't we just leave?

00:23:16.559 --> 00:23:17.039
Listen.

00:23:17.279 --> 00:23:19.039
I'll fetch Zhenzhu to pick up Grandma.

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.799
We leave tonight.

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:21.720
I'll find a boat.

00:23:22.119 --> 00:23:24.039
You'll get Ye Haitang

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:24.559
and Xin.

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:26.079
Will Grandma be able to move?

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.799
Will Xin come with us?

00:23:29.559 --> 00:23:31.119
Ye Haitang is studying for college.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.279
And where would we go?

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:33.880
And money?

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.240
He's backed us

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.279
into a dead end.

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:49.480
Let's take a gamble.

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:53.240
If we win, we live.

00:23:55.119 --> 00:23:55.920
If we lose,

00:23:59.119 --> 00:23:59.920
we die together.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:04.000
Alright.

00:24:06.799 --> 00:24:07.599
Let's get to work.

00:24:38.759 --> 00:24:39.559
Xun.

00:24:40.759 --> 00:24:43.599
I thought you'd be talking to Cha.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.319
You're back so soon.

00:24:48.559 --> 00:24:49.359
He wasn't there.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.039
What's wrong?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.759
Nothing.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:07.920
Seriously, it's nothing.

00:25:13.279 --> 00:25:14.960
Xun, how long have we known each other?

00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.000
How long exactly?

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.279
I've seen you angry,

00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.599
hurt,

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:33.400
happy,

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:34.839
upset,

00:25:35.839 --> 00:25:36.920
and keeping a secret

00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:37.920
like you are now.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.480
You've also seen me in every mood.

00:25:46.279 --> 00:25:48.960
We met just the day
before school started.

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:50.920
That wasn't long ago.

00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:56.920
But it feels like
we've known each other forever.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.960
We've been through more

00:26:03.039 --> 00:26:03.640
than others

00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.240
could have in a lifetime.

00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:17.200
When I was

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.359
at the orphanage,

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:27.920
Chubby Auntie always told us,

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:30.920
"Study hard,"

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:34.519
"so when you grow up,"

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.000
"you'll find a good job"

00:26:36.799 --> 00:26:38.240
"and live a stable life."

00:26:40.839 --> 00:26:41.519
But back then,

00:26:41.519 --> 00:26:43.920
adult life sounded so boring to me.

00:26:49.519 --> 00:26:50.480
What about now?

00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:59.240
Now, all I want is that stable life.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:01.599
But it's so hard.

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:06.480
Harder than schoolwork.

00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:09.319
Harder than acing exams.

00:27:11.279 --> 00:27:13.319
I used to fight and endure pain.

00:27:13.839 --> 00:27:15.200
I never cared.

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:18.200
I was never afraid.

00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:23.359
But this time,

00:27:26.079 --> 00:27:27.799
I'm really scared.

00:27:31.039 --> 00:27:32.599
I'm afraid of dragging you down.

00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.240
I'm scared that
something bad will happen

00:27:38.039 --> 00:27:38.839
to all of you.

00:27:40.519 --> 00:27:42.680
The bookstore closed because of me.

00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:45.319
And you

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.000
suffered because of me.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.720
I've never suffered because of you.

00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.640
Without you,

00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:56.400
I'd have died many times.

00:28:05.160 --> 00:28:06.039
Tang.

00:28:13.839 --> 00:28:17.000
If I ever bring you misfortune,

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.000
you must leave me.

00:28:24.559 --> 00:28:27.079
When have I ever feared misfortune?

00:28:32.079 --> 00:28:32.920
Having you

00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:35.920
is my greatest fortune.

to stand by my side.

So...

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.000
So I'm not afraid anymore.

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:48.039
I was just making noodles,

00:29:48.039 --> 00:29:48.680
and I came out

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.000
to buy some vinegar.

With you here,

I'm not afraid of anything.

With you here,

00:30:31.599 --> 00:30:33.559
I'm not afraid of anything, either.

Go ahead.

00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.519
Why did you ask to meet?

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:24.119
I'm settling accounts

00:31:25.519 --> 00:31:26.960
with the billiard house investors.

00:31:28.079 --> 00:31:28.880
Here's

00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.000
your initial investment.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.920
It's all here.

What are you doing?

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:39.920
Planning to leave here?

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.920
Don't be ridiculous.

00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:46.839
I used to complain about my fate,

00:31:51.039 --> 00:31:53.400
but if I could choose again,

00:31:54.799 --> 00:31:55.839
I'd follow the same path.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.079
Because it's worth it.

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:03.119
Those years with you

00:32:04.599 --> 00:32:06.039
were my happiest ones.

00:32:09.079 --> 00:32:11.000
I fear that in another life,

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:22.720
we might never have met.

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:29.440
So,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.519
I'm not saying this

00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:33.759
to ask for forgiveness.

00:32:35.799 --> 00:32:36.759
Don't forgive me.

00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:38.799
Don't wait for me, either.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:42.599
Are you in some kind of trouble?

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:44.519
Not at all.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:46.640
I just feel

00:32:47.319 --> 00:32:49.759
that it's time to confess my feelings.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.039
If I had listened to you
and gone legitimate

00:32:53.799 --> 00:32:54.799
sooner,

00:32:56.279 --> 00:32:57.680
my life could've

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.720
been different.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.599
And we could've gone further.

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:06.720
I'm sorry

00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:10.359
for what happened.

00:33:20.559 --> 00:33:22.559
After all these years,

00:33:23.359 --> 00:33:25.440
I finally hear you say sorry.

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.480
It's worth it.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:42.079
I know you have tried your best.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.519
Some things are beyond our control.

00:33:51.519 --> 00:33:53.119
Love alone isn't enough

00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:57.200
to make it to the end.

00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.079
I won't forget our past.

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.440
You owe me nothing.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.639
Not now,

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:16.840
not ever.

00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:30.679
So that's it.

What's wrong?

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.360
Have you seen Rat?

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.400
He left for the city
to run errands with Xun

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:22.960
this afternoon.

00:39:23.320 --> 00:39:24.000
What errands?

00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.079
I don't know.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.960
He wouldn't tell me.

00:39:29.239 --> 00:39:30.360
Is something wrong?

00:39:30.599 --> 00:39:31.079
Oh no.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.039
They're hiding something.

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:34.639
Xun told me that

00:39:34.639 --> 00:39:36.239
they would unload cargo tonight.

00:39:36.239 --> 00:39:37.440
But the wharf staff said

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:38.440
no ships are coming.

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.639
So I did see Rat in that van earlier.

00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:41.840
What?

00:39:42.039 --> 00:39:43.400
I saw a van today.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.679
I couldn't see who was inside,

00:39:44.679 --> 00:39:45.280
but someone

00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:46.480
was wearing a red vest.

00:39:46.480 --> 00:39:47.840
I knitted that for Rat.

00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:49.039
Wait, calm down.

00:39:49.039 --> 00:39:50.000
What kind of van?

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:52.840
A white one.

00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.480
It looked really dirty.

00:39:55.079 --> 00:39:55.519
Okay.

00:39:55.519 --> 00:39:56.280
Heading towards?

00:39:56.679 --> 00:39:58.039
Sihai Factory.

00:39:58.039 --> 00:39:58.800
Stay steady.

00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:00.119
Where are you going, Tang?

00:40:00.119 --> 00:40:01.159
That's the outskirts.

00:40:01.159 --> 00:40:02.199
Be careful.

00:40:09.639 --> 00:40:10.519
Xun.

00:40:10.719 --> 00:40:11.800
It's almost midnight.

00:40:12.039 --> 00:40:13.360
Why's there no one around?

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:15.840
Stop pacing around.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.480
Sit down.

00:40:17.119 --> 00:40:18.679
You think he might've

00:40:19.199 --> 00:40:20.599
lured us here

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.679
to hurt the girls instead?

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.079
Are they going after Zhenzhu?

00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:26.159
And what's actually

00:40:26.159 --> 00:40:27.679
inside these crates?

00:40:28.079 --> 00:40:29.119
Could it be drugs?

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:31.679
He tricked us into drug trafficking.

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:32.440
Rat.

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:34.320
Sit down.

00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:48.679
Rat.

00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:50.559
What is this?

00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.679
What's that smell?

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.280
Move.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:12.239
What are you doing?

00:41:15.079 --> 00:41:17.199
Cha only told us to guard the goods.

00:41:18.079 --> 00:41:18.920
What are you doing?

00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.519
If we pry it open

00:41:20.519 --> 00:41:21.440
and find something?

00:41:21.599 --> 00:41:22.639
Just listen to me, okay?

00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.000
Let go.

00:41:25.119 --> 00:41:26.159
If we find something,

00:41:26.159 --> 00:41:27.039
what should we do?

00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.000
Just rocks and bricks.

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.960
Don't open that one.

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:46.840
Listen to me this once.

00:41:58.719 --> 00:41:59.679
What is this?

00:42:01.079 --> 00:42:02.880
I told you to stop.

00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:03.639
Enough.

00:42:04.039 --> 00:42:05.000
We can still close it.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:05.679
We know nothing.

00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:06.519
Wait.

00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.800
Ignorance is innocence.

00:42:16.639 --> 00:42:17.440
Shen Xiaojun.

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:20.559
Xun.

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:23.280
Don't.

00:42:23.920 --> 00:42:25.559
Let me see if he's still alive.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.440
What if he's dead...

00:42:36.639 --> 00:42:38.079
He'll suffocate like that.

00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.840
Shen Xiaojun.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:49.599
I...

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:50.400
Don't scream.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:51.800
Shen Xiaojun.

00:42:52.599 --> 00:42:53.800
If someone hears you,

00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.440
we're done for.

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.159
Don't shout.

00:42:56.639 --> 00:42:57.599
Promise me.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:58.519
Don't scream.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.599
Rat.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:06.320
Take a look outside.

00:43:06.719 --> 00:43:07.679
What exactly

00:43:07.679 --> 00:43:09.000
should I look for outside?

00:43:09.199 --> 00:43:10.440
Take a look now.

00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:12.760
Wait for my signal.

00:43:19.159 --> 00:43:19.960
Get up.

00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:21.679
Shen Xiaojun.

00:43:22.559 --> 00:43:23.400
Why are you here?

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.039
Some guys

00:43:25.039 --> 00:43:27.719
threw me into a van near my house.

00:43:28.079 --> 00:43:29.199
They kept beating me.

00:43:29.199 --> 00:43:30.760
I don't know what happened,

00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:31.760
and I passed out.

00:43:32.159 --> 00:43:33.960
Then I woke up like this.

00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:37.239
Tang Yixun, why are you here?

00:43:37.239 --> 00:43:39.000
What's going on?

00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:41.880
I just launched a petition
to get you expelled.

00:43:42.079 --> 00:43:44.679
Do you need to kidnap me?

00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:47.960
Cha.

00:43:49.079 --> 00:43:49.920
What are you doing?

00:43:50.199 --> 00:43:51.960
Nothing.

00:44:02.519 --> 00:44:03.880
There's a person inside.

00:44:08.239 --> 00:44:09.079
Who is this guy?

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:09.920
He's my classmate.

00:44:10.039 --> 00:44:10.679
Spare me.

00:44:10.679 --> 00:44:12.159
My dad, Shen Dashan and my mum,

00:44:12.159 --> 00:44:13.280
Gao Xiaocui will pay you.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.239
Shut up.

00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:17.800
Who told you to open these?

00:44:18.199 --> 00:44:19.480
Why did you open these?

00:44:26.679 --> 00:44:27.599
There's no one here.

00:44:28.159 --> 00:44:29.159
Move a muscle

00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:30.119
or make a sound,

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:31.360
and I'll kill you.

00:44:32.559 --> 00:44:34.440
Got it. Okay.

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:40.000
Come out.

00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:45.679
It's fine. That's my buddy.

00:44:46.119 --> 00:44:47.239
We'll talk a bit.

00:44:47.559 --> 00:44:48.199
Wait for me.

00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.119
Why did you open the crate?

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:54.800
Cha.

00:44:55.599 --> 00:44:56.800
Thankfully, I opened it.

00:44:57.039 --> 00:44:57.719
Otherwise,

00:44:57.719 --> 00:44:58.840
he could have suffocated.

00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.639
Cha. Let's call the police.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.960
Let's explain everything.

00:45:03.159 --> 00:45:04.159
Bao's the real culprit.

00:45:04.159 --> 00:45:05.039
We're innocent.

00:45:05.039 --> 00:45:05.800
Bao did it.

00:45:07.119 --> 00:45:08.199
We transported him.

00:45:08.679 --> 00:45:10.039
He only saw us.

00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.400
We'll be in serious trouble.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.679
We're already in trouble.

00:45:13.679 --> 00:45:15.320
Shen Dashan won't let us off.

00:45:16.039 --> 00:45:17.599
This is kidnapping, Cha.

00:45:18.559 --> 00:45:19.159
I'm not afraid

00:45:19.159 --> 00:45:20.239
of calling the police.

00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:24.159
I'll go down along with Bao.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:26.360
But I'm scared that he may

00:45:26.519 --> 00:45:27.440
get away with it.

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.280
Then everyone

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:30.480
around us

00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.840
will be finished.

00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.719
I can't risk it.

00:45:35.679 --> 00:45:36.360
No matter what,

00:45:36.559 --> 00:45:37.800
we need to make a decision.

00:45:38.079 --> 00:45:38.760
Once they come,

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:39.719
we'll be doomed.

00:45:40.199 --> 00:45:41.280
Leave right now.

00:45:41.559 --> 00:45:42.400
I'll handle it.

00:45:42.559 --> 00:45:43.360
No way, Cha.

00:45:43.519 --> 00:45:44.840
Neither we nor he

00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:46.280
can stay here any longer.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:47.320
This is kidnapping.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:48.199
A capital offense.

00:45:48.199 --> 00:45:48.920
He's right, Cha.

00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:49.880
We can't get involved.

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:51.920
Listen.

00:45:52.679 --> 00:45:53.639
Let's release him.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.199
He's my classmate.

00:45:55.360 --> 00:45:56.360
Let me talk to him

00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:58.320
and explain the whole situation.

00:45:58.559 --> 00:45:59.079
I promise

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:01.079
he won't blab to the police.

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:04.119
How can you guarantee that?

00:46:04.639 --> 00:46:05.639
I'll speak to him now.

00:46:09.199 --> 00:46:11.239
Bao. Shen Dashan went to the police.

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:16.519
Clean it up.

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.920
Listen to me.

00:46:22.159 --> 00:46:23.239
The kidnapper is called

00:46:23.239 --> 00:46:24.199
Wu Jiabao, aka Bao.

00:46:24.199 --> 00:46:25.039
He tricked us.

00:46:25.039 --> 00:46:26.119
We were clueless.

00:46:26.639 --> 00:46:27.639
I'll take you home now.

00:46:27.639 --> 00:46:28.079
Okay?

00:46:28.280 --> 00:46:29.159
Okay.

00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:29.719
Okay.

00:46:31.599 --> 00:46:32.320
Get up.

00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:33.000
Come on.

00:46:35.519 --> 00:46:36.039
Try harder.

00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:38.880
Let's go.

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:42.280
Easy.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:43.440
Lean on me. Come on.

00:46:44.559 --> 00:46:46.159
Thank you.

00:46:46.159 --> 00:46:48.960
Thank you.

00:46:54.559 --> 00:46:55.360
Cha.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.639
My dad's Shen Dashan.
My mom's Gao Xiaocui.

00:47:14.639 --> 00:47:15.280
Please spare me.

00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:16.079
They'll pay you.

00:47:16.079 --> 00:47:16.880
Shut up.

00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.719
Li Chadong.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.079
I gave you a way out.

00:47:59.559 --> 00:48:00.880
You should've done the job,

00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:01.920
and we'd be cool.

00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:03.559
Why are you messing with me?

00:48:04.159 --> 00:48:04.840
Bao.

00:48:06.079 --> 00:48:06.800
Bao.

00:48:08.199 --> 00:48:10.000
We saw nothing.

00:48:11.079 --> 00:48:12.360
We'll stay silent.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.599
We won't ruin your plan.

00:48:15.079 --> 00:48:16.599
I promise.

00:48:17.400 --> 00:48:18.280
B-Bao.

00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:19.719
I swear

00:48:20.119 --> 00:48:21.800
we saw nothing.

00:48:22.119 --> 00:48:23.199
You saw nothing?

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:24.880
What about him?

00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:26.599
He saw you guys.

00:48:27.199 --> 00:48:28.440
How do we silence him?

00:48:31.519 --> 00:48:32.039
Bao.

00:48:32.639 --> 00:48:33.679
I'll make him quiet.

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:35.880
You want money, right?

00:48:36.119 --> 00:48:36.559
Listen.

00:48:37.119 --> 00:48:38.239
Take the money and leave.

00:48:38.239 --> 00:48:38.920
I'll talk to him.

00:48:39.079 --> 00:48:39.719
I promise

00:48:40.119 --> 00:48:41.239
he won't say a word.

00:48:46.119 --> 00:48:48.000
No wonder you losers can't make it.

00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.000
A bunch of stupid cowards.

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.800
How dare you mess with my plans?

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:56.760
Wait.

00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.760
Bao, wait.

00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:58.360
Hold on.

00:48:58.599 --> 00:48:59.840
Wait, Bao.

00:49:00.159 --> 00:49:02.480
Bao, wait.

00:49:03.679 --> 00:49:04.800
Let me do the killing.

00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:06.599
Let me do the killing.

00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.199
Let my buddies go.

00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:10.159
What're you saying, Cha?

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:11.679
If I kill him,

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:14.119
we're in this together.

00:49:14.639 --> 00:49:16.079
Then you can trust us.

00:49:17.039 --> 00:49:18.039
Let us go.

00:49:19.039 --> 00:49:19.480
No way.

00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.800
They're trying to set us up.

00:49:22.239 --> 00:49:23.079
Don't give in.

00:49:23.519 --> 00:49:24.159
Xun.

00:49:24.159 --> 00:49:25.360
This was Bao's fault.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:26.920
We didn't do anything.

00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:28.039
Shut up, Xun.

00:49:30.559 --> 00:49:31.360
Li Chadong.

00:49:32.079 --> 00:49:33.440
I can spare your life.

00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:37.440
But this one has to die.

00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.360
Do you want your other buddy to live?

00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:41.760
Make your choice.

00:49:49.079 --> 00:49:49.679
Rat.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:50.840
What are you doing?

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.440
Rat.

00:49:51.920 --> 00:49:54.320
Are you okay, Rat?

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:55.400
Rat.

00:49:55.840 --> 00:49:56.639
You bad guy!

00:49:56.639 --> 00:49:57.360
Shut up.

00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.679
Either you die together

00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:01.400
or you pick one.

00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:03.400
I'll haunt you forever.

00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:05.400
You all deserve to die.

00:50:06.760 --> 00:50:08.199
Bao, you bad guy.

00:50:13.079 --> 00:50:13.880
Rat.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:15.639
Rat.

00:50:16.079 --> 00:50:16.840
Cha.

00:50:17.519 --> 00:50:18.079
Choose.

00:50:20.440 --> 00:50:21.000
Cha.

00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:22.960
Take Rat and go

00:50:23.519 --> 00:50:24.320
to the hospital.

00:50:39.519 --> 00:50:40.320
Rat.

00:50:41.719 --> 00:50:43.079
Rat lost a point.

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:45.039
Xun.

00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:46.760
Xun.

00:50:49.079 --> 00:50:50.239
I'm sorry.

00:50:53.199 --> 00:50:54.920
I'll repay you in the next life.

00:51:04.719 --> 00:51:07.440
Xun.

00:51:09.199 --> 00:51:10.000
Xun.

00:51:10.519 --> 00:51:11.320
Xun.

00:51:12.159 --> 00:51:13.719
Rat, let's go.

00:51:15.159 --> 00:51:15.920
Listen to me.

00:51:16.159 --> 00:51:16.719
No.

00:51:16.719 --> 00:51:18.280
We can't leave Xun here.

00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.320
Let's go, Xun.

00:51:19.559 --> 00:51:20.639
Xun.

00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:23.000
Xun.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.559
Move it, Rat.

00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:27.960
Cha, we can't leave him here.

00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:30.840
Xun.

00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:32.320
Let's go, Rat.

00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:34.320
Xun.

00:52:03.920 --> 00:52:04.880
Cha, it's on fire.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.679
Cha.

00:52:05.679 --> 00:52:06.679
He'll die.

00:52:06.679 --> 00:52:08.000
We have to go in.

00:52:09.679 --> 00:52:10.320
Go.

00:52:36.079 --> 00:52:36.639
Xun.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.559
Xun, I'm here.

00:52:38.760 --> 00:52:40.360
Let him go.

00:52:41.320 --> 00:52:42.159
Go.

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:43.679
I told you to go.

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:44.679
I'm sorry.

00:52:44.679 --> 00:52:45.239
We messed up.

00:52:45.239 --> 00:52:46.800
We'll be your servants.

00:52:46.800 --> 00:52:48.159
Let him go, please.

00:52:48.159 --> 00:52:49.280
I'm your lackey.

00:52:49.280 --> 00:52:50.480
I'm your lackey.

00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.159
Cha.

00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.960
Die, all of you!

00:53:16.199 --> 00:53:17.280
Kill me.

00:53:19.239 --> 00:53:20.280
Go on, kill me.

00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.960
Shen Dashan, you loser!

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.760
You made enemies out there

00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.760
and won't save your son!

00:53:30.559 --> 00:53:31.360
Shen Xiaojun.

00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:32.880
A blade.

00:53:36.599 --> 00:53:37.400
Hurry.

00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:56.800
Shen Xiaojun, what are you doing?

00:53:57.440 --> 00:53:58.440
What do we do now?

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.360
We're going to burn.

00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:01.679
I'm going to die.

00:54:01.679 --> 00:54:05.480
We're done for. We'll be burned.

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:31.920
Xun.

00:54:32.079 --> 00:54:33.360
We'll be burned.

00:54:41.519 --> 00:54:42.679
Xun.

00:54:43.480 --> 00:54:44.639
Tang, go back.

00:54:45.159 --> 00:54:46.519
Ye Haitang, help.

00:54:46.519 --> 00:54:47.639
Hurry, Ye Haitang.

00:54:47.639 --> 00:54:49.079
Ye Haitang, go back.

00:54:50.119 --> 00:54:51.199
Go back.

00:54:51.199 --> 00:54:53.760
Come here. I'm burning alive.

00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.519
Help, Ye Haitang.

00:54:56.719 --> 00:54:58.440
There's a blade on the floor.

00:55:01.440 --> 00:55:02.599
I'm getting burned.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.239
Go away. It's dangerous.

00:55:04.599 --> 00:55:05.400
Tang.

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:07.639
Tang, get out now.

00:55:07.639 --> 00:55:08.480
Please.

00:55:08.639 --> 00:55:09.760
We leave together.

00:55:19.119 --> 00:55:19.920
Get the car.

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:23.760
You kidnapped him

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:25.320
and fell out.

00:55:26.519 --> 00:55:27.400
He called the police.

00:55:28.199 --> 00:55:28.679
And I

00:55:29.119 --> 00:55:29.960
stopped your crime.

00:55:30.239 --> 00:55:31.559
Thrilling story, huh?

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:34.760
What's that?

00:55:35.679 --> 00:55:37.360
Li Chadong's lighter for arson.

00:55:37.639 --> 00:55:38.840
He burned his own buddy?

00:55:39.679 --> 00:55:40.639
That's ruthless.

00:55:41.119 --> 00:55:41.559
Let's go.

00:55:46.079 --> 00:55:47.719
This way.

00:55:48.239 --> 00:55:48.760
Help her.

00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.880
Hurry up.

00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.639
Go.

00:55:53.079 --> 00:55:54.239
Run.

00:55:54.559 --> 00:55:55.880
Bao. They're escaping.

00:55:58.119 --> 00:55:58.760
Get them.

00:55:59.199 --> 00:56:00.079
Hurry up.

00:56:00.079 --> 00:56:01.039
Stay back.

00:56:05.239 --> 00:56:06.360
Cha. Rat.

00:56:08.519 --> 00:56:09.559
Xun.

00:56:09.880 --> 00:56:10.760
Run.

00:56:11.519 --> 00:56:12.320
Go.

00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:13.519
Take her away. Now.

00:56:13.719 --> 00:56:14.320
Go.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:14.920
Xun.

00:56:15.960 --> 00:56:16.960
Go.

00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:17.519
Let me go.

00:56:17.719 --> 00:56:18.480
Let go.

00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:18.960
Go.

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:20.159
Run.

00:56:25.480 --> 00:56:26.280
Cha.

00:56:26.679 --> 00:56:27.360
Xun.

00:56:27.719 --> 00:56:28.719
Leave us be.

00:56:28.719 --> 00:56:29.800
Go to the police.

00:56:30.039 --> 00:56:30.760
Freeze.

00:56:31.039 --> 00:56:31.840
Go to the police.

00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:33.599
Go to the police, Xun.

00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:38.719
Let's go.

00:56:40.280 --> 00:56:41.000
Get them.

00:56:41.559 --> 00:56:42.559
Don't let them escape.

00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:00.039
Fat Dog.

00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.840
They bullied me.

00:57:02.519 --> 00:57:03.719
Let's play stabby-stab.

00:57:04.599 --> 00:57:05.960
I'll treat you after.

00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.760
Fat Dog.

00:57:23.559 --> 00:57:26.039
You're worse than a mutt.

00:57:32.840 --> 00:57:33.480
Fat Dog.

00:57:38.159 --> 00:57:40.159
Fat Dog. Are you alright?

00:57:51.679 --> 00:57:53.079
Rat, let's take him down.

00:59:22.639 --> 00:59:25.360
Cha and I went to prison
for kidnapping Shen Xiaojun

00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.119
and stabbing Bao.

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.000
But Tang

00:59:30.519 --> 00:59:31.440
saved Xun.

00:59:33.239 --> 00:59:34.559
She risked her life

00:59:34.559 --> 00:59:36.920
and dragged him from the flames.

00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.280
She got burned.

00:59:38.840 --> 00:59:40.960
Those scars on my mom

00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:44.000
came from that day.

00:59:47.039 --> 00:59:48.559
Xun would also

00:59:49.639 --> 00:59:51.559
sacrifice anything for your mom.

00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:54.880
I asked him,

00:59:56.119 --> 00:59:57.639
"Why would you"

00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.800
"fight so hard for this woman?"

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:01.800
He told me that

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.239
he grew up orphaned

01:00:03.239 --> 01:00:04.159
with no family.

01:00:05.239 --> 01:00:06.800
Ye Haitang was the only one

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.400
who treated him as family.

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.880
All they wanted was to survive

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:12.719
together.

01:00:14.239 --> 01:00:15.320
They fought so hard.

01:00:17.239 --> 01:00:19.719
But it felt like fate targeted them

01:00:20.440 --> 01:00:22.159
and just wouldn't let go.

01:00:31.079 --> 01:00:31.920
Officer.

01:00:32.239 --> 01:00:33.840
Why is Tang Yixun still

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.639
being detained?

01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.679
The case is still under investigation.

01:00:37.400 --> 01:00:38.760
You're both badly injured.

01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.199
Listen.

01:00:39.519 --> 01:00:41.119
Get medical checks and come back

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:42.280
for statements later.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.519
I can give my statement now.

01:00:43.679 --> 01:00:45.000
Tang Yixun is innocent.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.119
He was already tied up when I arrived.

01:00:47.119 --> 01:00:48.519
Shen Xiaojun can testify, too.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.320
They were tied together.

01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:51.719
He's not with that gang.

01:00:51.719 --> 01:00:52.760
He's no criminal.

01:00:52.760 --> 01:00:54.079
And they beat him.

01:00:54.079 --> 01:00:55.000
He's injured.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.320
He can testify.

01:00:56.599 --> 01:00:58.079
Shen Xiaojun. Speak up.

01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:59.320
Clear Tang Yixun's name.

01:00:59.719 --> 01:01:00.440
Shen Xiaojun.

01:01:00.679 --> 01:01:02.079
I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:02.079 --> 01:01:03.599
I'm waiting for my mom.

01:01:03.599 --> 01:01:04.519
Don't cry.

01:01:05.039 --> 01:01:07.400
Shen Xiaojun, testify for Tang Yixun.

01:01:07.400 --> 01:01:08.199
- Xiaojun...
- I'll wait for my mom.

01:01:08.199 --> 01:01:09.599
Why are you crying?

01:01:10.039 --> 01:01:11.559
Mom.

01:01:12.679 --> 01:01:13.920
Xiaojun.

01:01:14.599 --> 01:01:15.719
What happened to you?

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.039
I almost got burned to death.

01:01:18.039 --> 01:01:20.519
Why did you take so long?

01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:22.159
How dare they kidnap my son?

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.159
You have to

01:01:23.159 --> 01:01:24.440
execute the kidnappers.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:25.880
Shen Dashan, you loser!

01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.960
You made enemies

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:27.960
and wouldn't pay them.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.199
I almost died in that fire.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:30.400
Mom, Shen Dashan

01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.199
was trying to kill me.

01:01:32.639 --> 01:01:33.519
You'd let my son die

01:01:33.519 --> 01:01:35.000
just to save some petty money.

01:01:35.559 --> 01:01:37.119
I won't let you off.

01:01:37.119 --> 01:01:37.960
Enough.

01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.480
Enough.

01:01:39.199 --> 01:01:39.760
Don't argue

01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.960
at the police station.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.320
Just you wait.

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.440
You'll pay for it.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:47.159
Let's go to the hospital.

01:01:47.159 --> 01:01:48.480
If anything happens to you,

01:01:48.599 --> 01:01:49.440
I'll kill him.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:50.440
You can't leave.

01:01:50.440 --> 01:01:51.679
Testify for Tang Yixun.

01:01:53.039 --> 01:01:53.559
Let go.

01:01:54.199 --> 01:01:54.960
How is my son

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.239
going to give statements?

01:01:56.519 --> 01:01:57.159
Shen Xiaojun.

01:01:57.360 --> 01:01:57.960
Who are you?

01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:59.239
You know a lot, huh?

01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.199
Shen Xiaojun.

01:02:00.719 --> 01:02:01.280
Shen Xiaojun!

01:02:01.280 --> 01:02:02.480
Have you no conscience?

01:02:02.599 --> 01:02:04.840
How many beatings
has Tang Yixun taken for you?

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.119
Stay out of this.

01:02:06.119 --> 01:02:08.360
Shen Xiaojun, testify for Tang Yixun.

01:02:09.119 --> 01:02:11.079
Shen Xiaojun, where's your conscience?

01:02:11.079 --> 01:02:13.400
Didn't Tang Yixun get beaten up
trying to save you?

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:14.320
Shen Xiaojun.

01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:15.480
He's not a bad person.

01:02:15.480 --> 01:02:16.679
He's not a criminal.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.320
Shen Xiaojun.

01:02:18.719 --> 01:02:20.639
Shen Xiaojun, please.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:28.239
Officer.

01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:30.159
Tang Yixun didn't kidnap me.

01:02:30.880 --> 01:02:33.039
They only caught him
because he was rescuing me.

01:02:33.639 --> 01:02:36.039
I testify that
Tang Yixun didn't kidnap me.

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:38.800
He kept trying to save me.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.079
Kid.

01:02:57.679 --> 01:02:58.880
You're badly injured.

01:02:59.199 --> 01:03:00.239
You'll get infected

01:03:00.239 --> 01:03:00.960
if you don't

01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:01.679
get treated.

01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:05.599
I'll wait for Tang Yixun.

01:03:08.320 --> 01:03:08.920
Li.

01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:09.880
Take her.

01:03:10.599 --> 01:03:11.400
Tang.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:13.800
Officers, I am

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:14.440
Tang's teacher.

01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:16.079
She's badly injured.

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:16.960
Get her checked up.

01:03:17.599 --> 01:03:18.199
Miss Tan.

01:03:18.719 --> 01:03:19.880
Xun's still inside.

01:03:20.239 --> 01:03:21.280
I know. Xun will be fine.

01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.280
Let's go to the hospital.

01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:24.280
Xun is innocent.

01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:26.360
Shen Xiaojun
already explained everything.

01:03:26.719 --> 01:03:28.280
I know.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:29.639
The police have informed

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.679
the school.

01:03:30.679 --> 01:03:32.079
Don't worry. Xun will be okay.

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:33.880
Let's go to the hospital.

01:03:34.519 --> 01:03:35.920
Thank you, officers.

01:03:36.039 --> 01:03:36.760
No problem.

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:41.679
Miss Tan.

01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.440
Will Tang Yixun be expelled?

01:03:53.079 --> 01:03:54.039
At least, he's alive.

01:03:56.679 --> 01:03:57.480
Go to the hospital.

01:04:02.159 --> 01:04:02.800
Come on.

01:04:11.719 --> 01:04:14.239
Back then, the three of us
opened a billiards house.

01:04:14.239 --> 01:04:15.119
It got trashed.

01:04:15.639 --> 01:04:17.239
After we reopened it,

01:04:17.239 --> 01:04:18.400
all of us took a photo

01:04:18.719 --> 01:04:20.000
in front of it.

01:04:21.480 --> 01:04:22.679
That blonde guy is me.

01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:25.159
This is my wife.

01:04:28.159 --> 01:04:29.199
And these two...

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.760
You know them.

01:04:31.679 --> 01:04:33.000
Tang and Xun.

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:36.079
I kept these photos

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:37.440
to hold onto the memories.

01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:45.119
If you find Xun, be sure to tell me.

01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.239
Absolutely, Uncle.

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.000
Absolutely.

01:05:06.199 --> 01:05:06.840
Oh man.

01:05:07.199 --> 01:05:08.559
The mailbox will be removed

01:05:08.800 --> 01:05:09.760
in three days.

01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:11.719
