WEBVTT

00:00:04.537 --> 00:00:05.805
Haruka.

00:00:05.872 --> 00:00:07.073
Haruka. Let's go out on a date.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.344
I can't let him find out.

00:00:12.012 --> 00:00:14.347
I can be with him forever
as long as we're friends.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:35.702
So you're dressed like a boy today.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:36.603
Yeah.

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.306
I wanted to show you.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.747
You want to know
whether it suits you or not?

00:00:48.648 --> 00:00:50.450
It looks really good on you.

00:00:50.517 --> 00:00:51.284
Very cute.

00:00:51.351 --> 00:00:52.185
Cute?

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:54.854
You can really pull off anything.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.223
You're way cuter than me.

00:00:57.924 --> 00:00:59.826
Your outfit suits you, too.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.261
Let's go.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.564
Thanks.

00:01:13.206 --> 00:01:14.441
Let's eat!

00:01:20.046 --> 00:01:21.481
Yummy!

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:23.583
Food makes me so happy.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.684
Calm down.

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.389
But it was worth researching.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:31.958
You went through all that trouble?

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:34.527
Thanks, sorry for leaving
everything to you.

00:01:35.028 --> 00:01:35.895
Not at all.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.733
Leave today to me, all you have to do
is be with me.

00:01:42.669 --> 00:01:43.503
Okay.

00:01:45.238 --> 00:01:48.108
Hikaru seems different than usual.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:51.778
Excuse me, I brought your desserts.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:54.514
We didn't order this.

00:01:54.581 --> 00:01:58.785
This is free for all our customers
who visit as a couple.

00:01:59.686 --> 00:02:01.688
- We're not--
- Thank you.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:03.156
Hikaru?

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:05.258
What's the harm?

00:02:05.925 --> 00:02:07.060
Being a couple.

00:02:10.363 --> 00:02:12.132
Why did he say that?

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:20.340
This is where you wanted to go?

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:23.943
Apparently, this is a date spot.

00:02:25.345 --> 00:02:26.179
Date?

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:29.182
I'll buy us tickets.

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:32.752
If he says stuff like that,

00:02:33.353 --> 00:02:36.222
I'll think this is an actual date.

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.458
That's so cute.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.426
There are so many.

00:02:40.493 --> 00:02:42.095
Wow, that's amazing.

00:02:42.162 --> 00:02:43.997
Look, there's a shark!

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:47.634
It feels like we're in the ocean.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:52.205
Is that Frederic behind us?

00:02:54.908 --> 00:02:56.176
Can I shake your hand?

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.746
Thank you.

00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.515
They're so pretty.

00:03:12.158 --> 00:03:13.426
What do I do?

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.929
Hikaru looks like some man I don't know.

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:19.699
I've felt so comfortable around him.

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:21.668
But now I can't calm down.

00:03:22.168 --> 00:03:24.003
Ready to move on?

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:32.378
Since it's dark in here.

00:03:33.846 --> 00:03:34.681
Wait.

00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:37.750
Sorry, I have to…

00:03:45.325 --> 00:03:47.060
What am I going to do?

00:03:47.126 --> 00:03:50.530
Hikaru's going to figure out how I feel.

00:03:53.132 --> 00:03:54.867
What the hell is this?

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.971
Don't worry. I don't date girls
who leave bras out.

00:04:03.142 --> 00:04:06.246
There's no way he'll see me as a woman
at this point.

00:04:13.653 --> 00:04:16.823
Plus, he already has a crush on someone.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.359
I'm happy just to be friends.

00:04:20.426 --> 00:04:22.829
So cute!

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:24.230
Yeah, they are.

00:04:25.832 --> 00:04:26.699
What's this?

00:04:28.268 --> 00:04:31.437
That's cool.
They even list their personalities.

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.172
What?

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.174
CUTE AND STYLISH, HONEST
WOULD BE A GOOD WIFE

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:40.213
OVAL FACE AND ALMOND EYES
VERY DEVOTED TO EBISU

00:04:42.582 --> 00:04:43.750
EBISU (FEMALE)

00:04:43.816 --> 00:04:46.019
LIKE AN IDOL TO ALL THE MALES
BUT SHE PICKED ORION

00:04:52.625 --> 00:04:55.762
I guess penguins experience
rich love lives.

00:04:59.032 --> 00:05:00.867
They have ice cream over there.

00:05:01.367 --> 00:05:04.570
I want to get away from love
as much as possible!

00:05:04.637 --> 00:05:07.573
You're not ready
for your next relationship?

00:05:08.107 --> 00:05:10.510
Huh? Where'd that come from?

00:05:10.576 --> 00:05:11.411
I mean,

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:15.181
look how proactive
the penguins' love lives are.

00:05:15.248 --> 00:05:17.417
Curse you, penguins!

00:05:17.483 --> 00:05:21.120
Is there nobody you're interested in now?

00:05:21.187 --> 00:05:22.188
There is.

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:24.757
I don't think so.

00:05:27.694 --> 00:05:28.628
I see.

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:32.699
What do I do?
It's the first time I've lied to Hikaru.

00:05:32.765 --> 00:05:36.803
Then what would you do
if someone came up and told you

00:05:38.037 --> 00:05:39.672
that they liked you?

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.507
Would you date them?

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:45.745
Of course not!

00:05:45.812 --> 00:05:47.080
Come on!

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.649
I'm coming fresh off a breakup.

00:05:49.716 --> 00:05:52.385
I'm not that easygoing.

00:05:52.452 --> 00:05:55.521
Easygoing is the last thing
I want Hikaru to think of me.

00:05:56.189 --> 00:06:01.694
Besides, I'm kind of over love right now.

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:07.533
I'm happy as long as
I have you as a friend.

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:12.305
I see.

00:06:13.973 --> 00:06:14.941
Got it.

00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:19.345
Why don't you wait there
while I get us ice cream.

00:06:21.147 --> 00:06:21.981
Okay.

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.885
I feel so guilty.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:28.054
Lying to Hikaru.

00:06:29.255 --> 00:06:33.025
But it will be awkward
if he finds out how I feel.

00:06:34.527 --> 00:06:37.730
And there's no way I'm going
to let that happen!

00:06:37.797 --> 00:06:38.664
Haruka.

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:40.900
Hey, Haruka!

00:06:42.668 --> 00:06:44.437
- What?
- It's going to drip.

00:06:46.806 --> 00:06:47.640
Sorry.

00:06:47.707 --> 00:06:48.541
Jeez.

00:06:52.745 --> 00:06:54.013
What was that for?

00:06:54.947 --> 00:06:56.149
It was dripping.

00:06:56.883 --> 00:06:58.851
Why would you do that?

00:06:59.952 --> 00:07:02.255
You suggested we should share it
cause it's expensive.

00:07:03.556 --> 00:07:05.825
He'll find out if I act like this!

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:09.095
Hikaru! You're being a tease!

00:07:09.662 --> 00:07:13.199
- Huh?
- I mean, you have a crush, right?

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.635
What if they saw you?

00:07:16.335 --> 00:07:20.473
Besides, some people might think
you're leading me on.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:21.474
What?

00:07:23.075 --> 00:07:24.944
Well, what about you?

00:07:25.011 --> 00:07:28.181
You're the one saying stuff to lead me on.

00:07:28.247 --> 00:07:30.082
Casually saying you love me.

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:32.285
It's not casually!

00:07:32.351 --> 00:07:33.386
I'm not so sure.

00:07:33.453 --> 00:07:34.987
You probably don't remember.

00:07:35.054 --> 00:07:38.257
I only say it to the people I love.

00:07:43.162 --> 00:07:44.363
Oh, no!

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:46.799
That sounded like a love confession!

00:07:49.135 --> 00:07:50.803
By person I love I mean--

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:52.305
What makes you like someone?

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.639
Huh?

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:56.209
A person who's nice?

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.244
Or handsome?

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:03.583
Or would you like someone who's manly?

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.491
You only see what's in front of you.

00:08:18.231 --> 00:08:19.098
Sorry.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:21.501
I can't do this.

00:08:24.103 --> 00:08:25.371
Let's call it a day.

00:08:25.938 --> 00:08:26.839
Be right back.

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:34.380
It's my fault.

00:08:35.114 --> 00:08:38.985
Because I'm hiding my feelings.

00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:40.052
I'm sorry!

00:08:55.101 --> 00:08:57.603
Am I going to continue to lie to Hikaru?

00:09:07.079 --> 00:09:09.482
See, you look so much better now.

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:21.027
That was pathetic.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:26.732
Hikaru.

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.134
Haruka.

00:09:29.235 --> 00:09:30.403
Sorry about earlier.

00:09:31.504 --> 00:09:32.371
Um.

00:09:34.907 --> 00:09:35.942
Listen, I…

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:50.222
I love you.

00:09:53.926 --> 00:09:56.362
I'm sorry for springing this on you.

00:09:57.196 --> 00:09:59.532
I know you already have
a crush on someone.

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.001
This might be inconvenient.

00:10:03.135 --> 00:10:05.838
But this love

00:10:07.073 --> 00:10:09.442
isn't platonic love for a friend.

00:10:11.911 --> 00:10:14.080
I don't care if I get rejected
and things get awkward.

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:19.118
I didn't like the way I acted
when I tried to hide my feelings.

00:10:21.754 --> 00:10:25.324
I was scared you might judge me
after helping me so much

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:28.628
with my relationship with Mr. Kurotaki.

00:10:30.596 --> 00:10:32.798
You might not believe me,

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:38.270
but I don't want to lie to you anymore.

00:10:41.707 --> 00:10:43.009
I love you.

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:47.847
I'm in love with you.

00:10:59.659 --> 00:11:02.862
Could you say something, please?

00:11:02.928 --> 00:11:04.030
I can't.

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:11.504
- I figured, thank you for--
- No!

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:13.539
That's not it.

00:11:16.475 --> 00:11:18.010
I don't mean it like that.

00:11:21.013 --> 00:11:22.848
You just caught me by surprise.

00:11:23.716 --> 00:11:24.550
I can't.

00:11:25.151 --> 00:11:26.018
I can't take it.

00:11:27.453 --> 00:11:28.387
What do you mean?

00:11:30.956 --> 00:11:32.324
You really don't know?

00:11:36.762 --> 00:11:41.067
Who do you think I arranged
this embarrassingly cliché date for?

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:47.139
I wanted to be the one to say it first.

00:11:49.308 --> 00:11:50.142
Huh?

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:51.911
What?

00:11:54.013 --> 00:11:55.047
Seriously?

00:11:56.782 --> 00:11:58.117
The one I love is Haruka.

00:12:04.690 --> 00:12:05.558
Wait.

00:12:05.624 --> 00:12:08.227
Who loves who?

00:12:09.628 --> 00:12:11.597
I love Haruka.

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:17.136
You, Hikaru,

00:12:18.437 --> 00:12:19.405
loves

00:12:20.773 --> 00:12:21.607
me?

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:27.613
You're lying!

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.714
What, why?

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:30.382
You said you have a crush!

00:12:30.449 --> 00:12:32.785
Yeah, and that's you.

00:12:32.852 --> 00:12:35.921
But why, you've seen all my bad sides.

00:12:37.123 --> 00:12:38.457
Well, that's true.

00:12:46.365 --> 00:12:49.702
You know how I asked you
what makes you like someone?

00:12:50.302 --> 00:12:53.305
Well, I don't know the reason why either.

00:12:55.341 --> 00:12:58.210
I mean, you're stupid and messy.

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:01.413
But

00:13:02.748 --> 00:13:04.583
I have fun being with you,

00:13:09.488 --> 00:13:11.457
and I want to be by your side
all the time.

00:13:14.627 --> 00:13:15.795
That's

00:13:17.696 --> 00:13:19.431
the same for me.

00:13:39.518 --> 00:13:40.886
Now do you believe me?

00:13:43.055 --> 00:13:45.424
You really are a tease!

00:13:45.491 --> 00:13:46.325
What?

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:48.894
Not as bad as you.

00:13:57.469 --> 00:13:59.738
For real? You confessed first?

00:13:59.805 --> 00:14:01.807
Look at you, taking the initiative!

00:14:01.874 --> 00:14:04.510
No, I just went with the flow.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:06.645
I'm so glad.

00:14:07.313 --> 00:14:09.748
Hikaru's feelings are finally paying off.

00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:14.186
Do you know how long Hikaru had a crush--

00:14:15.754 --> 00:14:17.857
was in love with me?

00:14:17.923 --> 00:14:21.560
Why don't you
save that question for Hikaru?

00:14:23.128 --> 00:14:26.498
So the crush Hikaru had was you all along.

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:30.102
Wait.

00:14:33.372 --> 00:14:36.609
This could be the perfect timing.

00:14:36.675 --> 00:14:37.643
A gift.

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:39.612
Really? Yay! What is it?

00:14:39.678 --> 00:14:40.846
Open it.

00:14:40.913 --> 00:14:41.780
Okay.

00:14:51.357 --> 00:14:54.293
Another freebie from my sponsor.

00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:56.128
Really? But this is…

00:14:56.195 --> 00:15:00.065
Nothing wrong with the girl
making the first move.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.274
Welcome.

00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.408
Thanks for having me.

00:15:11.477 --> 00:15:13.045
It's actually clean.

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.981
It's not like I'm planning anything!

00:15:16.649 --> 00:15:17.683
Planning?

00:15:18.984 --> 00:15:19.952
It's nothing.

00:15:21.287 --> 00:15:22.288
Man.

00:15:23.088 --> 00:15:26.825
You finally learned to clean up
before a guest comes.

00:15:27.893 --> 00:15:29.628
You can just take it easy.

00:15:29.695 --> 00:15:30.529
Why?

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:32.731
It will go faster if I help.

00:15:36.936 --> 00:15:39.872
You're going to get your sleeve wet.

00:15:40.806 --> 00:15:41.740
So close.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.844
Nothing.

00:15:47.346 --> 00:15:48.714
Okay, let's eat!

00:15:50.015 --> 00:15:50.849
Looks good.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:52.885
My mom made this for me a lot.

00:15:53.419 --> 00:15:56.322
Making it with extra meat
is a treat at home.

00:15:58.657 --> 00:15:59.558
Yum.

00:16:02.828 --> 00:16:05.597
You cooked me something
that's meaningful to you.

00:16:06.432 --> 00:16:07.466
That makes me happy.

00:16:09.301 --> 00:16:10.302
That's good.

00:16:11.804 --> 00:16:13.505
What do you want to drink?

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:16.809
Tea?

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:24.083
It's not what you think!

00:16:25.884 --> 00:16:28.320
Miorin gave it to me.

00:16:28.387 --> 00:16:30.322
I said I didn't need it.

00:16:33.926 --> 00:16:34.960
I see.

00:16:36.261 --> 00:16:37.296
What a relief.

00:16:40.599 --> 00:16:42.234
I thought you were scared of me.

00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:48.207
You've been acting nervous
ever since I rolled your sleeve.

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:53.012
I don't think coming over
automatically means that.

00:16:54.013 --> 00:16:55.581
What was Mio thinking?

00:16:56.715 --> 00:17:02.221
Sorry, I really invited you over today
just to make this hot pot for you.

00:17:03.122 --> 00:17:04.857
Yeah, I know.

00:17:07.793 --> 00:17:10.496
Don't worry, I want to take things slow.

00:17:11.463 --> 00:17:12.364
Hikaru.

00:17:13.098 --> 00:17:16.869
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't interested in it at all.

00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:20.672
But hearing you say you love me

00:17:21.907 --> 00:17:24.376
makes me plenty happy for now.

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:31.450
So how long

00:17:32.985 --> 00:17:35.054
have you had feelings for me?

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:37.222
Why?

00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:38.690
For me,

00:17:39.358 --> 00:17:43.162
it's when Shu said
he was going to take you to Korea.

00:17:43.228 --> 00:17:46.331
So I only realized it recently.

00:17:47.699 --> 00:17:48.534
Right.

00:17:49.635 --> 00:17:53.872
{\an8}But if you've liked me for a while now,

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:58.143
{\an8}I'm afraid I've done a lot
of insensitive things to you.

00:18:01.947 --> 00:18:04.149
{\an8}Don't worry about that.

00:18:05.484 --> 00:18:07.352
{\an8}Miorin gave me the lingerie.

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:13.025
{\an8}Which made me think
that I had to meet your expectations.

00:18:21.567 --> 00:18:26.338
{\an8}I feel like I'm going to die
from embarrassment right now.

00:18:27.372 --> 00:18:28.207
{\an8}Why?

00:18:31.477 --> 00:18:32.344
{\an8}Because

00:18:33.479 --> 00:18:39.118
{\an8}it's not like I'm not interested
in that stuff either.

00:18:42.354 --> 00:18:43.589
{\an8}Really?

00:18:44.890 --> 00:18:45.824
{\an8}Yes.

00:18:49.328 --> 00:18:50.462
Then, can I kiss you?

00:18:52.231 --> 00:18:53.899
- What?
- You know…

00:18:59.938 --> 00:19:03.275
I probably liked you from the beginning.

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:40.579
I feel like being in a relationship
is like creating many secrets together.

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:47.519
{\an8}I guess the two of us
aren't just friends anymore.

00:19:49.521 --> 00:19:50.856
{\an8}What? Mom?

00:19:50.923 --> 00:19:53.158
{\an8}I like any version of you.

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:55.060
{\an8}Hikaru has been really busy.

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:56.929
{\an8}I thought I had a chance.

00:19:56.995 --> 00:19:57.896
{\an8}Hold on.

00:19:57.963 --> 00:19:58.864
{\an8}I can't.

00:19:58.931 --> 00:20:01.900
{\an8}Only insecure men get jealous.

00:20:01.967 --> 00:20:03.402
{\an8}I'm taking Haruka back.

00:20:03.468 --> 00:20:04.836
