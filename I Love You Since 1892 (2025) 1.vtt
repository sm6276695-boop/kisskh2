00:11:26.466 --> 00:11:27.266

he was arrested

00:11:35.733 --> 00:11:36.533

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.966
because everyone knows that someone has liked me for a long time

00:13:32.066 --> 00:13:32.566
the boyfriend

00:13:32.566 --> 00:13:33.466

you will have a formal

00:13:56.766 --> 00:13:57.933
disciplinary action

00:13:58.533 --> 00:13:59.333

Well, it's business management.

00:14:51.266 --> 00:14:52.133
Let's go, of course.

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.700

00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:56.500
carmela

00:14:57.166 --> 00:14:57.966
there's a saying

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:59.866
that those who don't learn from history

00:15:00.666 --> 00:15:01.466
are doom

00:15:01.666 --> 00:15:02.600

00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:14.566

You're even more unlikely to graduate.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:29.300

00:15:30.566 --> 00:15:31.366

00:15:36.566 --> 00:15:38.866
This school of ours is from the seventeenth century.

00:15:38.933 --> 00:15:40.133
since it was built

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:40.766

00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:42.000
who testified that

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:43.966
but

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.333
if you don't believe

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:48.333
okay then

00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:50.733
You are passing by.

00:15:53.566 --> 00:15:54.966

00:15:55.700 --> 00:15:56.500

00:15:57.533 --> 00:15:58.666

00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:35.200
our history

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:39.100
It's been a while since I moved on from the past.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:40.900
and i hate

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:41.966

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:04.133
I was just asking if I could go to his party.

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:05.866

00:17:06.900 --> 00:17:07.700

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:15.733
I just plan to

00:17:15.733 --> 00:17:18.266
Shay gets jealous and envious at James' party

00:17:19.066 --> 00:17:20.266
but i don't care

00:18:28.366 --> 00:18:29.733
How fun are you?

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.100
Why can you look now?

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:03.333
you will fight

00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:07.800
You want trouble.

00:19:08.266 --> 00:19:08.866
if he/she

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:09.866
I will not fight.

00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:10.700

00:19:11.133 --> 00:19:12.066

00:19:15.566 --> 00:19:16.366

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:26.366
Are you okay?

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.133
You don't need me.

00:19:29.366 --> 00:19:30.200
Help me.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:31.966
I can do it myself.

00:19:32.166 --> 00:19:32.800
I don't want to.

00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.500
I see someone is being silly.

00:19:36.100 --> 00:19:38.066
And why did you let him go?

00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:41.466
and there are other ways to fight

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.066
and big

00:19:43.066 --> 00:19:44.000
dad's expectation of me

00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:45.100
i can't let him down

00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:46.966
saying

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:48.600
You're just kidding because you haven't experienced it yet.

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.600
to be hurt

00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.600
Don't you really have anything sensible to do?

00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:10.900
You're only giving me headaches.

00:20:11.933 --> 00:20:13.066
Can I have it, aunt?

00:20:13.266 --> 00:20:14.066
not here

00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.600

00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:16.566
you know how

00:20:16.566 --> 00:20:18.400
Be shy when you are scolded outside.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.500
but you don't care when you're embarrassed

00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:21.900
you in your work

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:24.600
If only I knew you were like this

00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.133
I shouldn't have taught you.

00:20:27.266 --> 00:20:28.066
okay

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:28.800

00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:29.900

00:20:40.566 --> 00:20:41.400
Who are you there?

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.100
by the way

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.600
is it just you

00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:47.400
alone here

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:48.800
well

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.600
i have two younger sisters

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.133
but they will come home later

00:20:53.366 --> 00:20:54.166
from school

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:56.866
parents mo

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:00.100
well my mom

00:21:00.266 --> 00:21:01.600
passed away when i was eight

00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:03.666
and then dad

00:21:04.366 --> 00:21:05.666
He is always busy with work.

00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:07.333
He comes home so late.

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.166
at least you

00:21:09.266 --> 00:21:10.766
Your dad works.

00:21:10.966 --> 00:21:11.866
going home too

00:21:12.733 --> 00:21:13.533
me too

00:21:14.533 --> 00:21:15.766
They are no longer the same.

00:21:17.866 --> 00:21:20.000
That's why my aunt is the one who supports me.

00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:22.500
Is that the one you were talking to earlier?

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:30.100
just in case you need it

00:21:30.300 --> 00:21:31.533
will make you smile

00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:32.666
I am here.

00:21:32.966 --> 00:21:34.700
You can come home anytime.

00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.566
I wish I hadn't taken you in.

00:21:37.933 --> 00:21:40.500
I wish I had just let you live alone.

00:22:09.266 --> 00:22:10.066
hi ate

00:22:11.666 --> 00:22:12.466

00:22:12.733 --> 00:22:14.333
Emily, why are you still awake?

00:22:15.733 --> 00:22:16.533

00:22:17.366 --> 00:22:18.166
Where are you from?

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:20.200

00:22:20.666 --> 00:22:23.900
Dad, I just came from my friend's birthday party.

00:22:24.666 --> 00:22:25.466

00:22:25.966 --> 00:22:27.300

00:22:29.266 --> 00:22:29.866
i thought

00:22:29.866 --> 00:22:30.866
you and shay

00:22:30.966 --> 00:22:31.966
were no longer friends

00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:33.900
and also

00:22:34.533 --> 00:22:35.566
mrs falcon

00:22:35.733 --> 00:22:36.533

00:22:36.866 --> 00:22:39.266

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.200

00:22:42.533 --> 00:22:43.333
dad

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.800
it was just a petty fight

00:22:46.966 --> 00:22:47.766
and this

00:22:47.766 --> 00:22:48.733
tough time for that

00:22:48.866 --> 00:22:49.200

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.966
I just came from the library.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.333
Well, I'm still studying.

00:22:52.866 --> 00:22:54.866

00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:57.700

okay i'm screwed

00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:04.766
What happened to you leaving your computer open?

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:06.500
your school portal

00:23:07.066 --> 00:23:07.766
there

00:23:07.766 --> 00:23:08.800
I printed it.

00:23:11.466 --> 00:23:13.366

00:23:15.100 --> 00:23:15.900

00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:17.566
they're all successful

00:23:18.933 --> 00:23:19.733
and you

00:23:20.733 --> 00:23:21.966
you're left behind

00:23:23.600 --> 00:23:24.400

00:25:22.466 --> 00:25:23.600

00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:24.600

Okay, son, mommy.

00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:01.600

necessary

00:27:12.966 --> 00:27:14.666
You are always the one who tolerates.

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:17.300
Isn't it just like nothing else?

00:27:18.966 --> 00:27:19.766

That's right, right?

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:47.400
dad

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.200
Are you still angry with me?

00:29:55.866 --> 00:29:56.666
child

00:29:57.866 --> 00:29:59.666

but when I scold you

00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:14.100
it doesn't

00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:15.200
It means I don't love you.

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.266
I love you brothers and sisters so much.

00:30:26.266 --> 00:30:27.066

dad

00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:29.766
Why are there suitcases?

00:30:29.933 --> 00:30:30.500
outside

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:31.300

00:30:31.933 --> 00:30:32.766
Where are we going?

00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:33.700

00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:35.500
Oh, Grandma Carmina.

00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:36.700
because you are requesting

00:30:37.133 --> 00:30:38.966
Let's go there before your birthday.

00:30:39.166 --> 00:30:41.266
oh well, we're not spending the weekend there, are we?

00:30:41.933 --> 00:30:44.366
Oh, I'll endure two days in the province.

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.766
Hey, you know it's been a while since we visited your grandmother.

00:30:49.166 --> 00:30:49.933

00:30:52.466 --> 00:30:53.600

Let's give a gift bag to your grandmother, okay?

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.066

me again

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.066
I am also older than you.

00:31:19.166 --> 00:31:20.866

It's been almost twelve years.

00:31:51.766 --> 00:31:52.866
When I last came here

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:54.500
I remember I was still here.

00:31:54.533 --> 00:31:56.266

00:31:57.066 --> 00:31:58.133

00:32:29.366 --> 00:32:30.900
I'm still bothering

00:32:31.333 --> 00:32:32.866
Come on, come in.

00:32:33.100 --> 00:32:33.900
say

00:32:34.133 --> 00:32:34.866
Why is that?

00:32:34.866 --> 00:32:35.866
Grandma is looking at you.

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:37.133
I don't know.

00:32:37.333 --> 00:32:38.366
Sister, do you know why?

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:39.600
why

00:32:39.766 --> 00:32:40.966
They say you're ugly.

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.200
wow jenny

00:33:34.533 --> 00:33:35.266

00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:47.466
Creepy is cool.

00:33:47.566 --> 00:33:48.266
so

00:33:48.266 --> 00:33:50.600
The things here are older than ours.

00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:51.866
my gosh

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.200
Maybe this place is haunted.

00:33:56.333 --> 00:33:58.066
That's why mommy said that.

00:33:58.200 --> 00:33:59.933
He really pushed me to study in Manila.

00:34:00.066 --> 00:34:01.166
when he went to college

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:03.666
because he feels like there's something going on in their house

00:34:21.466 --> 00:34:22.300
ate oh

00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:23.733

00:34:27.333 --> 00:34:28.566
Come on, look at that.

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:30.200
Oh, what is that?

00:34:39.133 --> 00:34:39.933

00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.566
what a shame, huh?

00:34:44.666 --> 00:34:45.700
You haven't seen him/her.

00:34:50.133 --> 00:34:52.066
hey don't be sad

00:34:52.933 --> 00:34:55.000

We both got mommy's beauty.

00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:02.733

00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.166

00:35:09.266 --> 00:35:10.500
that's why

00:35:10.733 --> 00:35:12.200
Grandma looks at you.

00:35:12.866 --> 00:35:14.166
Oh, you are like that.

00:35:15.866 --> 00:35:16.666

the widow

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:17.900
and

00:36:18.266 --> 00:36:19.333
I'm sorry.

00:36:19.566 --> 00:36:21.933
We haven't been back here to visit you.

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:24.200
Don't understand that anymore.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.300
We are talking on the phone.

00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.700

00:36:54.133 --> 00:36:55.900
I just remembered Carmenia.

00:36:56.966 --> 00:36:57.500

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.300
This is what his kaldereta tastes like

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:00.800
Really, dad?

00:37:01.333 --> 00:37:02.566
This is what mommy does.

00:37:05.266 --> 00:37:07.133
I taught him.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:10.866
it's from the ancestors

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.466
We have his recipe.

00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:14.000
you can do it

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:14.800
grandchildren

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:16.300
you need

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.200
learn

00:37:17.466 --> 00:37:18.566
the cooking

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:20.700
of the cauldron

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:22.533
Alamonte Carlos

00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:24.566
to pass

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:25.700
you in the next

00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:26.600
generation

00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.066
Hey Lola

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.466
Your last name isn't Monte Carlos, is it?

00:37:32.466 --> 00:37:33.266
but

00:37:33.466 --> 00:37:34.933
monte carlos is going to

00:37:36.066 --> 00:37:37.166
the source

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:38.333
of our race

00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:39.700
ah

00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:41.766
so we are

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:42.766
muntecaros

00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:45.100
so that won't change

00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:47.166
even a few

00:37:47.333 --> 00:37:48.100
generation

00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:49.166
more has passed

00:37:50.866 --> 00:37:52.000
so you can learn

00:37:52.166 --> 00:37:52.966
cook

00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.300
of the cauldron

00:37:58.733 --> 00:37:59.733
below the na

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:36.100
of

00:38:36.366 --> 00:38:37.066
the ugly

00:38:37.066 --> 00:38:37.866

00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:39.200
I'm so beautiful.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:40.900
This is grandpa.

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.766
Well, it's weird to look at me.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.866
but in fairness it has

00:38:47.166 --> 00:38:47.900
but

00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.500
I bet this room is very

00:38:50.566 --> 00:38:51.500
very classic

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.400
case like

00:38:53.666 --> 00:38:54.766
oh, that's scary

00:38:55.366 --> 00:38:56.266
This is grandpa.

00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:58.300
Jenny and I were even separated from each other in our room.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:38:59.400
Hey, I am.

00:39:00.933 --> 00:39:01.733

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.466
Why aren't you sleeping yet?

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.500
It's still early, isn't it?

00:39:31.966 --> 00:39:32.766
actually

00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:35.166
Every midnight, I'm just on my way home.

00:39:36.933 --> 00:39:37.733

00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:42.600

00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.500

a bit creepy

00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.100
That's really grandma's smile

00:41:21.766 --> 00:41:24.300
but with so many expensive things here

00:41:24.466 --> 00:41:27.133

00:41:35.566 --> 00:41:37.300
