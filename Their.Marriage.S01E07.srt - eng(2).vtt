00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:07.590
Your wife subconsciously ruins

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:09.175
and hurts the people around her.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.053
There are many people who have
something against her,

00:00:12.137 --> 00:00:13.054
so be careful.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.850
The truth is, they're reinvestigating
the case from 15 years ago.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.062
And that night,
Nella saw another person there.

00:00:21.938 --> 00:00:24.733
Now they're looking into
the involvement of a third party.

00:00:25.942 --> 00:00:28.611
We're family,
so let's help each other when in need.

00:00:38.788 --> 00:00:39.956
Hello?

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.460
Just now, a man claiming to be the killer

00:00:43.543 --> 00:00:47.088
in Fuse's case 15 years ago
turned himself in.

00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:50.091
His name is…

00:00:53.595 --> 00:00:55.972
Ko Suzuki, 60 years old.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.683
I work as a golf teaching professional.

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:05.440
That's all.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:07.442
Wait a second, please.

00:01:08.193 --> 00:01:10.612
What is he saying?

00:01:11.613 --> 00:01:13.448
We will begin questioning him now.

00:01:15.658 --> 00:01:17.160
Thank you for letting me know.

00:01:17.786 --> 00:01:18.703
It's nothing.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.884
Nell…

00:01:35.887 --> 00:01:38.765
Should I wake her up? Maybe it can wait.

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:43.102
Even if I don't wake her up right now,
she'll find out later anyway.

00:01:44.646 --> 00:01:46.105
No, I should wake her up.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.065
Nella.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.485
It's me.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.196
What's wrong?

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.449
Ko left the house, leaving this behind.

00:01:59.786 --> 00:02:01.496
It's a letter to all of us.

00:02:04.916 --> 00:02:05.959
Kurokawa.

00:02:07.585 --> 00:02:08.419
Yes?

00:02:08.503 --> 00:02:11.005
- I heard the culprit turned himself in?
- Yes.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:13.591
So it wasn't Nella Harada,
but her uncle, huh?

00:02:14.384 --> 00:02:16.344
It wasn't what you suspected,
but good job.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:18.888
We don't know until we question him.

00:02:18.972 --> 00:02:20.348
I'm counting on you.

00:02:42.453 --> 00:02:45.165
I'm Kurokawa,
from the First Investigation Division.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.792
You were always in front of our house?

00:02:48.793 --> 00:02:49.836
Yes.

00:02:53.423 --> 00:02:57.552
"Dear Kan, Nella, Leo, and Kotaro,

00:02:58.803 --> 00:03:00.597
I apologize for surprising you like this.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.891
When I heard that the case

00:03:02.974 --> 00:03:07.395
was reopened
and Nella was under suspicion again,

00:03:07.478 --> 00:03:10.523
I just couldn't stay silent any longer.

00:03:10.607 --> 00:03:12.901
So I've decided to turn myself in.

00:03:14.736 --> 00:03:15.820
On that day,

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:19.324
15 years ago,
in the afternoon of August 13th,

00:03:19.407 --> 00:03:22.869
- I made croissants, which Fuse liked…"
- I made croissants, which Fuse liked…

00:03:22.952 --> 00:03:24.913
- "…so I visited his atelier."
- …so I visited his atelier.

00:03:26.372 --> 00:03:27.498
Then I heard a thud

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.460
from the second floor,
as if something had fallen.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:33.796
And I got a bad feeling.

00:03:41.971 --> 00:03:43.097
On the second floor,

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:46.893
Fuse was on top of Nella,
who was on the floor,

00:03:46.976 --> 00:03:48.937
and strangling her.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.107
I wanted to save Nella,

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:56.527
so I took a candlestick that was there,

00:03:57.528 --> 00:03:59.697
and I hit Fuse on the head from behind.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.033
I was desperate.

00:04:05.662 --> 00:04:08.539
- I didn't know why it happened.
- "I didn't know why it happened."

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.625
- I thought they were…
- "I thought they were

00:04:10.708 --> 00:04:12.710
getting along very well,

00:04:12.794 --> 00:04:14.629
so I was shocked that Fuse

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:16.965
would try to kill Nella.

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:18.967
On top of that,

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.177
I trembled upon realizing that

00:04:21.261 --> 00:04:22.512
I had killed Fuse.

00:04:23.263 --> 00:04:24.555
The next moment…"

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:25.974
The next moment,

00:04:28.601 --> 00:04:30.979
I was overcome with the desire
to protect myself.

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:34.607
So,

00:04:36.651 --> 00:04:38.653
I dropped Fuse's body from the stairs

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:40.905
and made it seem like an accident.

00:04:45.743 --> 00:04:48.246
What did you do with the weapon
you used to hit Mr. Fuse?

00:04:48.329 --> 00:04:49.622
I tossed it in a river.

00:04:49.706 --> 00:04:51.374
Where is this river?

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:52.583
In between

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.962
the atelier and our condo.

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:07.307
So, you're saying

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:11.561
that you hit Mr. Fuse on the head
to save Ms. Nella's life?

00:05:12.145 --> 00:05:13.688
- Yes.
- Well then, why did you

00:05:14.272 --> 00:05:16.316
abandon Ms. Nella and leave the scene

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:18.109
after the incident?

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.571
Weren't you worried about her?

00:05:24.198 --> 00:05:25.325
I heard

00:05:26.576 --> 00:05:27.618
a cellphone ring somewhere

00:05:30.204 --> 00:05:31.539
and I happened to look at Nella.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.083
She heard the sound and started moving

00:05:35.209 --> 00:05:36.711
and was about to wake up.

00:05:40.506 --> 00:05:41.591
So I instinctively ran.

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:43.384
You ran?

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.928
I thought Nella would feel hurt

00:05:46.763 --> 00:05:48.556
if she found out about what I did.

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:56.022
When she was still young,
she lost her mother and younger brother.

00:05:57.648 --> 00:06:00.485
She'd been living with
a strong feeling of loss.

00:06:01.861 --> 00:06:05.406
If she found out that her uncle
killed her fiancé on top of that,

00:06:06.074 --> 00:06:07.867
- it would've been unbearable--
- That sounds

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.744
like an excuse.

00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:11.913
I didn't have the heart

00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:14.457
to tell Nella, when she woke up,

00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:17.585
that I killed Fuse to save her life.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:20.546
"I know I had no right to,

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:25.426
but at that moment, I thought that
making it seem like Fuse died

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:28.596
from falling down the stairs

00:06:29.097 --> 00:06:31.307
would be for Nella's sake.

00:06:33.476 --> 00:06:34.477
After the incident…"

00:06:35.144 --> 00:06:37.230
When Nella was under suspicion,

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:39.440
I thought about turning myself in.

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:43.778
But when I thought about Leo,
who views me like his mother…

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:46.656
"But when I thought about Leo,

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.867
I lost my resolve."

00:06:51.285 --> 00:06:52.328
And most of all,

00:06:53.454 --> 00:06:55.123
I cared about myself.

00:06:55.957 --> 00:06:57.041
"In time, the police

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:01.087
came to the conclusion that
Fuse's death was an accident.

00:07:02.338 --> 00:07:05.216
So I came this far, without having to tell

00:07:05.299 --> 00:07:06.300
the truth.

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:07.969
I do not know what

00:07:08.553 --> 00:07:11.222
circumstances led to the reopening

00:07:11.305 --> 00:07:12.723
of this case,

00:07:13.307 --> 00:07:15.893
but I knew that I could not allow Nella,

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:19.814
who just found her happiness,

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:22.525
to be the target of suspicion again."

00:07:25.111 --> 00:07:26.112
Fifteen years ago,

00:07:27.613 --> 00:07:28.906
I hid my crime

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.493
and abandoned Nella.

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:36.122
I'm finally ready to pay for it.

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.836
"To my brother,

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.715
I'm sorry that you have
a murderer for a younger brother.

00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:48.843
Ever since we were kids,

00:07:49.427 --> 00:07:50.470
you've protected me.

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.430
Please forgive me

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.767
for tarnishing your career.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.897
Nella,

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:03.232
- because I stayed silent…"
- Because I stayed silent,

00:08:03.858 --> 00:08:06.277
you had to go through
the humiliating experience

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.738
of being suspected as the killer.

00:08:08.821 --> 00:08:10.865
I am truly sorry.

00:08:13.034 --> 00:08:14.118
Please forget about

00:08:15.578 --> 00:08:17.788
a coward like me
and live happily with Kotaro.

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:20.875
Leo,

00:08:22.084 --> 00:08:25.630
I've lived my life up until now,
thinking that I have to protect you.

00:08:26.672 --> 00:08:29.800
But I've realized that
that isn't true at all.

00:08:30.801 --> 00:08:31.969
Please forget about the past,

00:08:33.137 --> 00:08:34.347
believe in yourself,

00:08:35.181 --> 00:08:36.974
and spread your wings.

00:08:38.976 --> 00:08:42.146
Lastly, Mr. Kotaro Harada,

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.857
I believe Nella was destined

00:08:44.941 --> 00:08:46.150
to meet you.

00:08:47.777 --> 00:08:49.070
Please take care

00:08:49.862 --> 00:08:51.489
of Nella.

00:08:54.492 --> 00:08:55.493
"Ko."

00:09:08.297 --> 00:09:10.591
If Ko hadn't hit Fuse,

00:09:12.176 --> 00:09:14.262
Nella would've been killed, right?

00:09:14.929 --> 00:09:16.973
Doesn't that count as self-defense

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:19.267
or some kind of defense?

00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:22.144
If what he wrote in that letter is true,

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.647
I think we can claim defense of others.

00:09:24.730 --> 00:09:25.773
Really?

00:09:26.607 --> 00:09:29.068
Will you be his defense attorney?

00:09:29.151 --> 00:09:32.655
Okay. I will go to the police department
and meet up with him now.

00:09:33.239 --> 00:09:34.156
I'm counting on you.

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.491
Thank you.

00:09:49.255 --> 00:09:50.923
It's going to be a long process,

00:09:51.007 --> 00:09:53.467
so make sure you eat breakfast, okay?

00:09:54.051 --> 00:09:55.761
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:09:55.845 --> 00:09:57.013
Bye.

00:10:15.615 --> 00:10:17.033
What a day…

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.582
It's Ko…

00:10:25.916 --> 00:10:27.627
He must have made it before he left.

00:10:49.148 --> 00:10:50.441
Let's eat.

00:11:10.127 --> 00:11:11.712
This is several times more shocking

00:11:12.505 --> 00:11:14.340
than the day I was kicked out
of my company.

00:11:28.729 --> 00:11:30.272
Stop crying and eat.

00:12:07.977 --> 00:12:10.688
I don't need you to defend me.

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.359
I understand that you don't want to
cause trouble for your family.

00:12:15.443 --> 00:12:16.277
But

00:12:16.861 --> 00:12:18.904
you won't find many lawyers
as skilled as me.

00:12:20.322 --> 00:12:21.157
I don't need it.

00:12:22.533 --> 00:12:24.577
Please don't say that.

00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:26.912
This is what Father wants too.

00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:30.291
I'll have a public defender represent me.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.209
Please

00:12:33.878 --> 00:12:35.337
don't come here anymore.

00:12:54.356 --> 00:12:55.941
How is the family?

00:12:56.817 --> 00:12:59.028
Thank you for the call this morning.

00:12:59.653 --> 00:13:00.613
It's nothing.

00:13:00.696 --> 00:13:03.032
I came here wanting to be his lawyer,

00:13:03.699 --> 00:13:04.783
but I was turned down.

00:13:05.743 --> 00:13:08.078
But do you think he really--

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:09.163
Mr. Kurokawa!

00:13:09.830 --> 00:13:10.706
We got the warrant.

00:13:11.665 --> 00:13:12.750
I'll be there.

00:13:25.304 --> 00:13:26.597
That day, in the afternoon,

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:28.599
the police searched his house

00:13:28.682 --> 00:13:30.100
{\an8}on the third floor.

00:13:30.184 --> 00:13:30.809
{\an8}TOKYO METROPOLITAN POLICE DEPARTMENT

00:13:46.283 --> 00:13:47.952
By the evening,
an arrest warrant was issued,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:52.998
and Ko Suzuki was

00:13:54.875 --> 00:13:57.461
arrested for the murder of Yuto Fuse.

00:14:21.443 --> 00:14:23.612
My body has been tense since this morning,

00:14:23.696 --> 00:14:24.864
so my shoulders feel weird.

00:14:25.489 --> 00:14:26.782
I'll massage your shoulders.

00:14:26.866 --> 00:14:29.034
But you worked harder than me today.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:30.786
I'm used to difficult situations.

00:14:39.086 --> 00:14:41.463
This was only supposed to be
a shoulder massage.

00:14:42.047 --> 00:14:43.591
You're like a professional.

00:14:43.674 --> 00:14:46.176
I'm good at giving massages.

00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.804
- That's the spot.
- Your muscles are so tight.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.014
Right there.

00:14:51.181 --> 00:14:52.266
That feels great.

00:14:52.975 --> 00:14:54.435
It's like being in a hot spring.

00:14:57.021 --> 00:14:58.814
It feels so good I'm getting sleepy.

00:14:59.398 --> 00:15:00.608
You can fall asleep.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:04.862
Those feet

00:15:05.529 --> 00:15:06.906
were Ko's feet, huh?

00:15:09.533 --> 00:15:12.912
I wonder if Ko can fall asleep
inside the detention center?

00:15:14.079 --> 00:15:15.039
What kind of place is--

00:15:15.122 --> 00:15:16.790
Don't think about it today.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.881
I'm so glad to have you, Kotaro.

00:15:31.931 --> 00:15:33.891
It's hard to believe that I was

00:15:33.974 --> 00:15:35.768
happily single up until recently.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:38.854
Now, not only do I have a wife,

00:15:38.938 --> 00:15:40.356
but I've embraced her whole family,

00:15:41.148 --> 00:15:43.192
among which there is a murderer.

00:15:44.276 --> 00:15:46.195
What kind of change in fate is this?

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.950
You sure are amazing
for being able to change me.

00:16:15.683 --> 00:16:18.227
That must have been
very stressful for you.

00:16:19.937 --> 00:16:23.482
I'm sure you are going through a lot too,

00:16:23.565 --> 00:16:24.984
but we are

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:28.779
in a predicament as well,
with all the parents asking questions.

00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.531
- I'm sorry.
- No, no…

00:16:30.614 --> 00:16:32.366
It's not your fault.

00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:33.909
No need to apologize.

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:38.288
But you know,
this is a place for learning.

00:16:38.372 --> 00:16:39.373
So,

00:16:39.873 --> 00:16:42.292
it's troubling for the school

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:45.045
when you have the press showing up here.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:48.590
Even though it was a long time ago,

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:52.052
the fact that your fiancé was killed

00:16:52.970 --> 00:16:56.932
by your uncle makes for
a sensational story.

00:16:57.599 --> 00:16:58.892
You're firing me?

00:16:58.976 --> 00:16:59.893
No, no…

00:16:59.977 --> 00:17:02.604
We can't do that, in this day and age.

00:17:03.856 --> 00:17:05.482
You're telling me to quit voluntarily?

00:17:05.566 --> 00:17:07.317
Ms. Suzuki,

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:09.862
please don't be so defensive.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.906
If you want me to take a break,

00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:14.408
- I will.
- Well,

00:17:14.491 --> 00:17:18.495
if that is what you want to do,
that would be helpful.

00:17:18.579 --> 00:17:20.664
If you choose to do that,

00:17:20.748 --> 00:17:23.208
I'm sure the parents
would stop complaining.

00:17:24.793 --> 00:17:25.961
Well then,

00:17:26.045 --> 00:17:29.882
I will send over the paperwork
for a leave of absence request.

00:17:29.965 --> 00:17:30.924
Okay.

00:17:31.800 --> 00:17:35.471
Thank you very much for understanding
the school's situation.

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:40.309
I'm sure things will be difficult for you,

00:17:41.977 --> 00:17:43.103
but do your best.

00:18:11.423 --> 00:18:12.257
I'm back.

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:14.968
What's wrong?

00:18:15.052 --> 00:18:18.388
A director and producer
from JPN Television are here.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:29.358
Thank you for waiting.

00:18:31.485 --> 00:18:32.986
If you had called, I would've rushed back.

00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:34.905
I am sorry it's so sudden.

00:18:34.988 --> 00:18:35.948
Have a seat, please.

00:18:40.494 --> 00:18:42.079
Thank you for always working with us.

00:18:42.162 --> 00:18:45.374
I am Mori,
the director for JPN Television.

00:18:45.457 --> 00:18:46.416
Hello.

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.044
Mr. Harada, your existence

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.297
brings life to News Hope,

00:18:52.381 --> 00:18:54.466
and I am always so grateful for that.

00:18:56.009 --> 00:18:57.010
Did you

00:18:57.094 --> 00:18:59.763
come here today
to tell me to leave the show?

00:19:02.015 --> 00:19:02.933
No…

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.060
It's not "leaving" the show.

00:19:05.644 --> 00:19:09.356
It's just that, if we cover the case
involving your relative on the show,

00:19:09.982 --> 00:19:12.693
and you are in the commentator's seat,

00:19:12.776 --> 00:19:14.903
it will compromise the fairness
of the broadcast.

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:16.738
That's the consensus at JPN Television.

00:19:17.531 --> 00:19:18.657
And so,

00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.450
we came here to ask you

00:19:20.534 --> 00:19:23.078
to take a break from
the show for a little while.

00:19:24.371 --> 00:19:26.540
Understood. I will do that.

00:19:26.623 --> 00:19:27.791
Wait a second!

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:32.296
You went all out
when it was about Kajiwara,

00:19:32.379 --> 00:19:34.923
but you give up like it's nothing
when it's about you?

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:37.426
- Kurasawa?
- What happened 15 years ago

00:19:37.509 --> 00:19:39.511
has absolutely nothing to do
with Mr. Harada.

00:19:39.595 --> 00:19:42.514
He met his wife just recently.

00:19:42.598 --> 00:19:45.142
Whether the culprit
is his wife's uncle or not,

00:19:45.225 --> 00:19:47.686
it is not Mr. Harada's fault at all.

00:19:47.769 --> 00:19:50.063
The fairness of the broadcast
will not be compromised.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.149
The constitution states that

00:19:52.232 --> 00:19:54.985
"all of the people shall be
respected as individuals."

00:19:55.068 --> 00:19:56.695
What his wife's family does

00:19:56.778 --> 00:19:58.113
has nothing to do with him!

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.577
I'm terribly sorry.
Kurasawa is stepping out of line.

00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.996
If you kick Mr. Harada out,
I will quit too.

00:20:06.079 --> 00:20:07.039
Hey!

00:20:07.748 --> 00:20:08.582
Don't do that.

00:20:08.665 --> 00:20:09.833
I will quit!

00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:12.920
I apologize for coming here without

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:14.463
coming to an agreement.

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:15.505
However,

00:20:16.173 --> 00:20:17.299
what I say

00:20:17.382 --> 00:20:20.219
represents JPN Television's stance
and decision.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:21.637
I understand.

00:20:22.679 --> 00:20:24.514
- I'm sorry.
- I won't give up.

00:20:24.598 --> 00:20:26.767
- Please give up.
- I won't give up.

00:20:26.850 --> 00:20:29.603
Everyone in the News Hope team
feels the same way as me.

00:20:29.686 --> 00:20:31.605
We will all work together

00:20:31.688 --> 00:20:34.024
and overturn the company's decision!

00:20:34.107 --> 00:20:36.026
- It won't be overturned.
- That's fine.

00:20:36.109 --> 00:20:38.320
Don't worry about me.

00:20:38.403 --> 00:20:40.739
You just focus on making a good show.

00:20:40.822 --> 00:20:42.491
No! I quit!

00:20:43.533 --> 00:20:45.244
I'm sorry for my subordinate's outburst.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:46.453
We will be leaving now.

00:20:46.536 --> 00:20:47.996
Let's go, come on!

00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:50.457
- Mr. Harada isn't in the wrong!
- Kurasawa! Kurasawa!

00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.960
- So you don't have to quit!
- Goodbye. I'm sorry.

00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:56.129
- Kurasawa! Kurasawa!
- Why does he have to take a break?

00:20:56.213 --> 00:20:57.673
- Why?
- Shut up!

00:20:58.674 --> 00:21:00.884
Television people sure are passionate.

00:21:01.635 --> 00:21:05.097
But that woman was kind of sexy.

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:11.103
Although I am
about to lose one of my jobs,

00:21:11.186 --> 00:21:14.773
it's good that Imaizumi sees
the beauty in Producer Kurasawa

00:21:14.856 --> 00:21:16.942
and is showing signs of growth as a human.

00:21:17.901 --> 00:21:20.529
Look, even your eyes are twice as big now.

00:21:21.488 --> 00:21:22.364
What?

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:26.076
It's not just one job
that you are about to lose.

00:21:26.159 --> 00:21:27.244
Huh?

00:21:27.828 --> 00:21:31.373
Chikutomi Trading Company called to say
that they're changing their legal advisor.

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.418
And your lecture at Teito University

00:21:34.501 --> 00:21:37.254
and your workshop
in Hirayama City were canceled.

00:21:39.006 --> 00:21:40.799
That's how people are nowadays.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:42.592
What cowards.

00:21:44.428 --> 00:21:45.595
It can't be helped.

00:21:46.638 --> 00:21:49.725
We will take care of things
for the time being, so don't worry.

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.852
My eyes are bigger now, after all.

00:21:53.478 --> 00:21:55.522
How reliable. Thank you.

00:21:55.605 --> 00:21:56.857
I'll do my best.

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:08.327
You really married one hell of a woman.

00:22:08.994 --> 00:22:10.537
Nella is a victim too.

00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:12.497
Seeing how she tarnished your name,

00:22:12.581 --> 00:22:15.459
it doesn't change the fact that
your wife brings bad luck.

00:22:17.252 --> 00:22:18.337
You should take a break.

00:22:19.046 --> 00:22:21.089
Now you're telling me to take a break too?

00:22:21.757 --> 00:22:23.342
Mr. Imaizumi is more motivated now,

00:22:23.884 --> 00:22:25.469
since he got divorced.

00:22:27.596 --> 00:22:28.972
Just take a break.

00:22:29.931 --> 00:22:31.224
It's for your own sake.

00:22:38.815 --> 00:22:39.649
It's Mr. Harada!

00:22:39.733 --> 00:22:41.318
Let's ask him some questions!

00:22:41.401 --> 00:22:43.653
- Mr. Harada!
- Mr. Harada!

00:22:51.536 --> 00:22:55.415
I am Kazuo Hayashi,
from Mimata Law Office.

00:22:55.499 --> 00:22:58.752
I was assigned as your public defender.

00:22:59.669 --> 00:23:00.962
I'll be in your care.

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:05.258
Regarding the murder that you are
being accused of,

00:23:05.842 --> 00:23:08.595
did you admit to it
during the questioning?

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:10.972
Or did you deny it?

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.099
I admitted to it.

00:23:13.141 --> 00:23:16.269
You admitted
that you were the one who did it?

00:23:16.353 --> 00:23:17.437
Yes, that's right.

00:23:17.979 --> 00:23:21.108
Ko Suzuki is fully admitting to his crime,

00:23:21.191 --> 00:23:25.153
but we still haven't found the candlestick
that he threw into the river.

00:23:25.237 --> 00:23:27.155
It was viewed as an accident 15 years ago,

00:23:27.906 --> 00:23:30.951
so we don't have any of
the deceased's belongings anymore.

00:23:31.034 --> 00:23:34.287
And we didn't find any evidence from
the items we recently confiscated.

00:23:35.247 --> 00:23:38.125
It's hard to find anything,
since it was 15 years ago.

00:23:38.208 --> 00:23:41.253
But for the most part,
his statements match the autopsy results.

00:23:43.713 --> 00:23:45.006
Is this enough for prosecution?

00:23:49.845 --> 00:23:51.930
CAUSE OF DEATH
WAS A FRACTURE OF THE LEFT PARIETAL BONE

00:23:54.432 --> 00:23:56.268
I wanted to save Nella,

00:23:57.144 --> 00:23:59.521
so I took a candlestick that was there,

00:24:00.522 --> 00:24:02.440
and I hit Fuse on the head from behind.

00:24:03.692 --> 00:24:04.734
I was desperate.

00:24:06.486 --> 00:24:08.196
Two hits, out of desperation?

00:24:08.947 --> 00:24:10.198
It was 15 years ago,

00:24:10.282 --> 00:24:12.325
so maybe he doesn't remember

00:24:12.409 --> 00:24:14.035
how many times he hit him?

00:24:17.539 --> 00:24:18.707
Mr. Kurokawa.

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:22.043
We found Takatoshi Misugi, the art dealer,
who was missing.

00:24:25.881 --> 00:24:27.382
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:24:28.091 --> 00:24:31.678
Today, Mr. Harada,
our commentator, is on break.

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:34.890
In his place, an associate professor
from Sanyo University

00:24:34.973 --> 00:24:36.516
who specializes in chimpanzees,

00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.020
{\an8}- Professor Mamoru Yuki will join us.
- Hello, I'm Yuki.

00:24:40.103 --> 00:24:42.981
{\an8}I will dissect the news
from a primate's perspective.

00:24:43.064 --> 00:24:44.691
{\an8}- Glad to be here.
- Thank you.

00:24:44.774 --> 00:24:46.651
- What is a "primate's perspective"?
- Professor Yuki,

00:24:46.735 --> 00:24:48.195
it's your first time on live TV, right?

00:24:48.278 --> 00:24:50.822
News Hope!

00:24:58.872 --> 00:25:02.000
Thinking from a primate's perspective,
chimpanzees are drawn to

00:25:02.083 --> 00:25:03.293
things that are

00:25:03.376 --> 00:25:05.503
- right in front of them.
- This guy is good.

00:25:05.587 --> 00:25:08.131
But humans try to acknowledge
things that aren't there.

00:25:08.215 --> 00:25:11.593
Running the video now.
It'll be 3 minutes and 25 seconds.

00:25:11.676 --> 00:25:13.929
Professor Yuki, you are amazing.

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.138
Really?

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:16.431
Please keep it up.

00:25:19.184 --> 00:25:20.393
There are situations

00:25:20.477 --> 00:25:23.146
where people exchange aggressive comments
on social media.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:24.981
From a primate's perspective,

00:25:25.065 --> 00:25:26.650
it's similar to the indirect

00:25:26.733 --> 00:25:28.735
aggression seen in monkeys with

00:25:28.818 --> 00:25:31.446
strict hierarchy,
like chimpanzees and macaques.

00:25:31.529 --> 00:25:32.822
Within the troop…

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:35.742
He is trying to steal your place.

00:25:36.910 --> 00:25:38.286
That's fine.

00:25:38.370 --> 00:25:39.829
That's the reality of TV.

00:25:39.913 --> 00:25:41.289
Really?

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.875
Rather than directly making a move,

00:25:44.501 --> 00:25:48.088
they protect themselves
by attacking indirectly.

00:26:01.309 --> 00:26:02.185
They're still there.

00:26:04.062 --> 00:26:05.397
He's not listening.

00:26:09.567 --> 00:26:11.987
The whole world was against us now.

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.072
From this day, we began quarantining.

00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:37.721
We cleaned our house so much,
it started looking like a model home.

00:26:44.477 --> 00:26:48.106
Right now, we are in front of
Mr. Kotaro Harada's home.

00:26:48.189 --> 00:26:52.360
Ever since this case came to light,
he hasn't said a word.

00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.525
The flavor is good,

00:27:32.609 --> 00:27:35.195
but only having
rice, chicken, and cilantro

00:27:35.278 --> 00:27:36.321
is a bit sad…

00:27:36.404 --> 00:27:39.115
That's why I added minestrone on the side.

00:27:39.199 --> 00:27:40.533
You made it, Kotaro?

00:27:40.617 --> 00:27:43.370
Yes. Both Nella and I have
lots of time, after all.

00:27:43.453 --> 00:27:44.829
We can help with other things too.

00:27:45.747 --> 00:27:47.123
I like this.

00:27:47.916 --> 00:27:49.167
I want Ko to try it too.

00:27:49.793 --> 00:27:51.795
There's some left, right?
I'll take some to him.

00:27:51.878 --> 00:27:53.963
You can't give him food.

00:27:55.673 --> 00:27:56.800
You can't?

00:28:03.681 --> 00:28:07.936
Without you, Kotaro, News Hope
on Tuesdays is lackluster and boring.

00:28:08.645 --> 00:28:10.063
- Isn't it?
- Right?

00:28:10.647 --> 00:28:13.358
That university professor is annoying too.

00:28:13.942 --> 00:28:14.901
- Seriously.
- Right?

00:28:20.865 --> 00:28:23.535
I'm sorry for dragging you into
our family's trouble.

00:28:27.747 --> 00:28:31.167
Reporters are swarming my office too,

00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:34.838
so it would've caused an uproar
if I went on TV. It can't be helped.

00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:37.424
I'm on a leave of absence too,

00:28:37.507 --> 00:28:40.093
so it's almost unbelievable
how much time we spend together.

00:28:40.176 --> 00:28:43.346
So Kotaro and I are experiencing a crisis.

00:28:44.055 --> 00:28:44.889
What?

00:28:47.392 --> 00:28:48.518
We're not getting along?

00:28:48.601 --> 00:28:50.270
Well, I mean,

00:28:50.353 --> 00:28:53.565
spending all of your time with a woman
is what you hate the most, right?

00:28:54.190 --> 00:28:56.317
That's why you were single
for 50 years, right?

00:28:57.569 --> 00:28:59.446
You're stepping out of your comfort zone

00:28:59.529 --> 00:29:01.406
even to sleep side by side with me, right?

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:02.949
I'm surprised she could tell.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:05.994
That's not true! You're an exception.

00:29:06.745 --> 00:29:09.080
- Really?
- Really.

00:29:11.166 --> 00:29:12.000
Really?

00:29:20.425 --> 00:29:21.468
Thank you for the food.

00:30:15.897 --> 00:30:16.898
It's heavy!

00:30:16.981 --> 00:30:18.942
- I can't!
- Stop there!

00:30:19.025 --> 00:30:19.859
Let it down.

00:30:21.528 --> 00:30:23.029
That was heavy.

00:30:26.241 --> 00:30:27.534
- Here.
- Thanks.

00:30:31.454 --> 00:30:32.539
It's twisted!

00:30:34.582 --> 00:30:37.043
- It's broken! It's broken!
- Stop it!

00:30:37.126 --> 00:30:38.753
This is creepy. Let's stop this movie.

00:30:38.837 --> 00:30:41.130
No, I want to watch.

00:30:41.214 --> 00:30:44.133
We didn't talk about her uncle.

00:30:44.217 --> 00:30:45.343
It's all smashed.

00:30:45.426 --> 00:30:48.513
And in order to keep our minds
off the case,

00:30:48.596 --> 00:30:50.348
we tried to have more fun than usual.

00:31:05.446 --> 00:31:10.618
Ko Suzuki was questioned by prosecutors.
Hiroshi Honma is the prosecutor in charge.

00:31:11.452 --> 00:31:12.370
Thanks.

00:31:23.715 --> 00:31:24.591
What's wrong?

00:31:25.633 --> 00:31:28.720
With both of us not working right now,

00:31:28.803 --> 00:31:30.972
will we be able to survive?

00:31:32.307 --> 00:31:34.893
That's what you were thinking about
this morning?

00:31:34.976 --> 00:31:35.852
Yeah.

00:31:37.061 --> 00:31:38.313
It'll be fine.

00:31:39.105 --> 00:31:41.107
I'm still doing little jobs even now,

00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:44.152
and if it comes to it,
I can sell my condo in Shiba Park.

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:48.698
Hey,

00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:51.993
why don't you try doing
art restoration again?

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:54.662
You got experience in Italy, after all.

00:31:59.792 --> 00:32:01.377
No matter how much you worry over it,

00:32:02.003 --> 00:32:04.130
the case from 15 years ago
will be solved soon.

00:32:08.551 --> 00:32:10.762
Stop thinking that you are the one
who cornered Fuse.

00:32:12.513 --> 00:32:13.514
From now on,

00:32:14.182 --> 00:32:16.059
you have to live for yourself.

00:32:24.025 --> 00:32:25.902
- Then…
- Yeah?

00:32:26.778 --> 00:32:28.279
I want to go on a honeymoon.

00:32:28.363 --> 00:32:29.864
I said, live for "yourself."

00:32:29.948 --> 00:32:32.325
I want to go on a honeymoon, for myself.

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:34.786
Then Hawaii. The Maldives?

00:32:35.870 --> 00:32:37.830
I'd like to go to Italy with you too.

00:32:37.914 --> 00:32:39.415
- Nikko
- Nikko?

00:32:42.377 --> 00:32:43.544
Nikko…

00:32:46.047 --> 00:32:47.966
TOSHO-GU

00:32:51.135 --> 00:32:53.054
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

00:32:53.638 --> 00:32:55.306
I wanted to see that so bad.

00:32:55.390 --> 00:32:57.058
That's why you chose Nikko?

00:33:01.354 --> 00:33:02.814
I wonder how that realtor is doing?

00:33:02.897 --> 00:33:03.940
"See no evil,

00:33:04.023 --> 00:33:06.317
hear no evil, speak no evil"

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:07.860
is the golden rule in real estate.

00:33:08.444 --> 00:33:10.989
I've been wanting to come to Tosho-Gu
ever since then.

00:33:11.072 --> 00:33:12.615
He was the reason?

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:24.419
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

00:33:27.755 --> 00:33:29.924
Wow! I can feel the negative air ions!

00:33:30.008 --> 00:33:31.592
It feels amazing.

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:34.554
Surprisingly,
nobody notices that it's you.

00:33:34.637 --> 00:33:36.305
They don't expect me to be vacationing.

00:33:37.849 --> 00:33:39.475
Let's take a photo.

00:33:39.559 --> 00:33:42.061
- The waterfall.
- Waterfall?

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.147
- What?
- It doesn't fit.

00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:46.858
- Like this?
- Want me to take it for you?

00:33:47.692 --> 00:33:48.943
Yes, please.

00:33:53.406 --> 00:33:55.450
Wait… Mr. Harada?

00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:57.076
What?

00:33:59.537 --> 00:34:00.872
Okay, say cheese.

00:34:02.248 --> 00:34:03.416
Thank you!

00:34:03.499 --> 00:34:04.667
No problem.

00:34:06.169 --> 00:34:07.128
That was scary.

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:08.880
You shouldn't have asked them.

00:34:08.963 --> 00:34:10.089
I couldn't help it.

00:34:11.132 --> 00:34:12.425
- Let me take one of you.
- What?

00:34:12.508 --> 00:34:14.427
- What should I do?
- Ready?

00:34:15.928 --> 00:34:17.388
Say cheese!

00:34:49.712 --> 00:34:50.546
Mr. Kurokawa.

00:34:51.047 --> 00:34:53.007
Mr. Misugi, the art dealer, is here.

00:34:53.091 --> 00:34:54.759
He's waiting in the meeting room.

00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:02.767
After that incident,
my art dealing business wasn't doing well,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.144
so I moved to New York.

00:35:05.228 --> 00:35:08.564
When I came back to Japan,
the owner of Ember

00:35:08.648 --> 00:35:12.068
told me that the police were
looking for me, so I was so surprised.

00:35:13.027 --> 00:35:14.904
Thank you for coming here.

00:35:14.987 --> 00:35:16.280
But

00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:18.950
the culprit turned himself in, right?

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:22.829
I totally assumed that woman did it.

00:35:23.579 --> 00:35:24.997
Why did you think that?

00:35:25.998 --> 00:35:28.292
Because of the last painting Fuse painted.

00:35:30.253 --> 00:35:31.254
Is that

00:35:33.131 --> 00:35:34.507
{\an8}this painting?

00:35:36.634 --> 00:35:38.886
{\an8}Yes, that's the one.

00:35:38.970 --> 00:35:42.140
When he started painting this,
Fuse told me…

00:35:42.223 --> 00:35:45.017
Once I complete this painting,

00:35:45.643 --> 00:35:47.228
I'm thinking of marrying Nella.

00:35:47.937 --> 00:35:50.731
I'll have children with her
and have a family.

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:53.025
I want to live happily with her.

00:35:53.985 --> 00:35:55.695
Don't become too stagnant.

00:35:57.488 --> 00:36:01.868
That's why I'm thinking of trying out
a new style for this painting.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:05.454
I thought that

00:36:05.538 --> 00:36:08.249
his artwork would definitely
become valuable one day,

00:36:08.332 --> 00:36:12.253
so after the incident,
I took in all of Fuse's artwork.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:13.546
I have it even now.

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:44.577
When I saw this ripped painting,

00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:45.870
I knew right away

00:36:46.537 --> 00:36:47.788
that Fuse

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.166
died because of that woman.

00:37:08.017 --> 00:37:09.644
I don't want to go home today.

00:37:09.727 --> 00:37:11.020
Me neither.

00:37:11.103 --> 00:37:15.066
It's funny how humans can feel happiness
even in horrible situations like these.

00:37:16.484 --> 00:37:19.737
You mourned for 15 years,
so you don't have to

00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:20.863
punish yourself anymore.

00:37:22.156 --> 00:37:25.326
That's not it. I'm talking about
how amazing you are, Kotaro.

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:27.703
You are able to give me so much happiness.

00:37:28.496 --> 00:37:29.538
You're a smooth talker.

00:37:30.164 --> 00:37:31.457
Leo told me,

00:37:31.540 --> 00:37:33.501
"Now that you're with Kotaro,

00:37:33.584 --> 00:37:35.753
you've begun to share your real feelings."

00:37:36.545 --> 00:37:38.589
He said that you're pretty amazing.

00:37:41.342 --> 00:37:43.344
Hey, let's stay one more night.

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.388
I'll go ask the hotel.

00:38:08.119 --> 00:38:09.328
They said no.

00:38:09.912 --> 00:38:11.747
They're fully booked for two months.

00:38:23.092 --> 00:38:24.844
The reporters aren't here.

00:38:29.098 --> 00:38:31.100
NIKKO NINGYO-YAKI

00:38:33.352 --> 00:38:35.396
They're shaped like
the three wise monkeys.

00:38:35.479 --> 00:38:38.733
- Three wise monkeys?
- See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil.

00:38:38.816 --> 00:38:40.026
Oh, those?

00:38:40.109 --> 00:38:41.902
Dad, you liked ningyo-yaki, right?

00:38:41.986 --> 00:38:43.863
You used to always tell us to get some

00:38:43.946 --> 00:38:46.073
from Kameido in Ueno, remember?

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:47.116
I did.

00:38:47.199 --> 00:38:48.701
Shall we try these ningyo-yaki?

00:38:48.784 --> 00:38:49.869
Yeah.

00:38:51.537 --> 00:38:53.331
I'm thinking about moving out.

00:38:57.043 --> 00:38:59.003
What made you think that?

00:39:00.046 --> 00:39:00.880
Did people

00:39:00.963 --> 00:39:02.298
find out about where you live

00:39:02.381 --> 00:39:04.133
and cause you trouble at work?

00:39:04.216 --> 00:39:05.926
No, my work is fine.

00:39:06.010 --> 00:39:09.513
The president and performers told me that
they value my talent over anything else.

00:39:11.682 --> 00:39:14.101
Totally different from TV stations
and schools.

00:39:14.185 --> 00:39:17.229
Then why do you have to move out?

00:39:18.773 --> 00:39:21.067
Reading the letter that Ko left behind

00:39:21.150 --> 00:39:23.027
made me think that I should move out.

00:39:23.110 --> 00:39:25.738
Ko never told you
to move out in his letter.

00:39:26.322 --> 00:39:28.032
You want to be alone?

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:30.576
That's one reason.

00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.539
First, Ko is gone,

00:39:36.165 --> 00:39:38.125
and now Leo too, huh?

00:39:38.209 --> 00:39:39.043
Sorry.

00:39:39.126 --> 00:39:40.169
Do what you want.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.630
Want me to refer you to a realtor?

00:39:42.713 --> 00:39:44.632
He can't keep secrets.

00:39:44.715 --> 00:39:47.301
I'm sure he's not the one
who spoke about Kajiwara.

00:39:47.385 --> 00:39:49.136
You think so?

00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:51.847
It's okay. The president is going to
look for a house for me.

00:39:53.265 --> 00:39:54.725
They really take care of you, huh?

00:39:54.809 --> 00:39:55.768
Yeah.

00:40:41.522 --> 00:40:43.607
These weren't a product
of Fuse's imagination,

00:40:43.691 --> 00:40:45.401
but actual objects in the room?

00:40:47.611 --> 00:40:48.821
Just this is missing.

00:41:05.045 --> 00:41:07.506
I took a candlestick that was there,

00:41:07.590 --> 00:41:10.050
and I hit Fuse on the head from behind.

00:41:31.906 --> 00:41:34.325
You're sure the weapon was a candlestick?

00:41:34.909 --> 00:41:35.701
Yes.

00:41:38.162 --> 00:41:40.748
Can you draw that candlestick right here?

00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:43.459
Yes.

00:42:32.299 --> 00:42:34.134
{\an8}- Where is it coming from?
- Our house?

00:42:35.719 --> 00:42:36.887
{\an8}I'll check the bathroom.

00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:54.196
{\an8}- It's not our house.
- Upstairs?

00:42:54.780 --> 00:42:56.031
{\an8}Dad!

00:42:59.994 --> 00:43:02.454
{\an8}- Dad!
- It wasn't me.

00:43:04.331 --> 00:43:05.332
{\an8}Leo!

00:43:20.306 --> 00:43:22.349
{\an8}- Leo!
- Leo!

00:43:23.851 --> 00:43:24.810
{\an8}Leo!

00:43:24.893 --> 00:43:26.145
{\an8}That's it!

00:43:26.228 --> 00:43:28.272
{\an8}- Water! Water!
- Okay!

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.776
{\an8}Leo!

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:36.655
Leo! Leo! Leo!

00:43:36.739 --> 00:43:38.115
Leo!

00:43:38.198 --> 00:43:40.409
Leo! Leo!

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:09.897
You didn't do it. Listen to me.

00:44:10.522 --> 00:44:13.359
The one who killed him was me.

00:44:14.026 --> 00:44:15.319
Okay?

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:30.626
{\an8}IS HIS WIFE THE REAL KILLER?

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.920
{\an8}No matter how you look at it, it’s me.

00:44:33.003 --> 00:44:35.255
{\an8}If you really did kill someone,

00:44:35.339 --> 00:44:37.299
{\an8}as a lawyer and as your husband,

00:44:37.383 --> 00:44:38.509
{\an8}what am I supposed to do?

00:44:38.592 --> 00:44:40.177
{\an8}I plan to find the truth myself.

00:44:40.260 --> 00:44:41.553
{\an8}I knew you’d say that.

00:44:41.637 --> 00:44:44.932
{\an8}There was a reason
why the killer had to do that.

00:44:45.015 --> 00:44:45.891
