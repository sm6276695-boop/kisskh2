Episode 33

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.280
Be careful.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.200
Thank goodness,
my gorgeous face isn't hurt.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.120
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.520
You two put me too close to the fire.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.400
The sparks were burning me.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.600
I couldn't hold it in.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.560
No wonder I thought it was strange.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.120
It turns out to be…

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.440
A broom demon.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.480
That's quite unlucky.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.400
Spare me, Celestial Master. Spare me!

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.720
I didn't mean to disturb you.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.640
I'm just a no-name broom demon.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.240
No, don't catch me!

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.640
You didn't do anything wrong.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.800
I won't take you in.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.160
Get up.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.480
That's right.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.440
Are you always here?

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.760
Yes, that's right.

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.400
I want to ask you something.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.080
What is it?

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.040
Have you heard of Zhu Yu herb?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.200
Zhu…

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.920
Zhu… Zhu…

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.480
Zhu, Zhu, Zhu…

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.000
It's fine. I got it.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.280
I'll leave now.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.120
I'll make room for you both.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.400
I'm off.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.920
What herb is it? What's it for?

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
It's a medicine.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.440
It's used to cure diseases and save lives.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.640
Cure diseases and save lives?

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
Are you sick?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.560
Help…

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.680
Halt!

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:18.360
Help…

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.320
Here.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160
Slowly.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.360
Granny, are you all right?

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.120
I'm fine. I slipped and fell.

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.440
I'm just a little dizzy.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.560
Thank you, miss.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.680
Granny, are you going into the mountain
to collect herbs?

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.240
Yes.

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.920
My ancestors have lived
on this mountain for generations.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.520
We collect herbs for a living.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.240
Have you heard of the Zhu Yu herb?

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:51.520
Zhu Yu herb?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.080
I think I've heard of it somewhere

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.360
Do you know where the Zhu Yu herb is?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.040
Yes.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.280
A well-known doctor named Gu
lives on this mountain.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.000
In her garden,
she grows all kinds of herbs.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.480
Maybe you'll find what you're looking for.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.440
- Young Master, let's go and take a look.
- Sure.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.360
- Thank you, Granny.
- Thank you.

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:15.440
Let's go.

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:21.840
Wait.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.520
Why don't we give Granny a ride?

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.120
Mm-hmm.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.320
You must be here to attend the banquet
and request medicine.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400
Please follow me.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.280
It appears that many have come,

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.160
drawn by reputation.

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.560
Dr. Gu is amazing.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.000
I heard that she has cultivated
to the level of a half-immortal.

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.800
I imagine dealing with mortal affairs

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:40.800
is nothing to her.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.960
I don't know
if she's half-immortal.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.080
But I heard that she has something divine.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.000
It's called the Zhu Yu herb.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.080
Did all of you come here
for the Zhu Yu herb as well?

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.480
Everyone comes here for the Zhu Yu herb.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.320
Thank you for coming
all the way here.

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.400
That's my master in there.

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.400
My wife and I came here uninvited.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.160
Please forgive us for disturbing.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.360
Don't worry about it.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.840
Those who are sincere
will get what they want.

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:19.640
It's that Granny's voice.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.640
Be careful later.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.280
Everyone, you're here for medicine.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:26.480
You should know everything
in this world comes with a price.

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.040
Ailments vary in seriousness.

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.320
I shall speak with each of you in turn.

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.840
Please wait outside and rest
until you're called.

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:49.600
Sir, you have an extraordinary aura.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.640
I'm sure you have everything you need.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.160
May I know why you're in need of medicine?

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.480
Me?

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.800
My family owns a silk shop.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.120
I've lived a rich and prosperous life
since I was young.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.080
It's true that I don't need
to ask for much.

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.720
But I'm middle-aged.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:05.840
Although I have many wives and concubines,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:07.920
I only have a few daughters.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.720
I've never had a son.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.320
I had no one
to inherit my family business.

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.240
So, you want the herbs
because you want a son.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.800
I'll get the herb no matter
how much it costs.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.720
Sir, my master would like to talk to you.

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:36.920
Oh.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:41.080
Why is he the first one?

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.680
Exactly. In terms of time,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.720
we've been waiting for a long time
as well.

00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.880
Dear guests, please calm down.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.440
My master said everything will be fair.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.480
Whether this illness can be cured,
and how it should be treated,

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.040
has nothing to do with the order
of the conversations.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.760
Sir, please enter.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:08:59.960
Eh?

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.320
There's no fairness in this world.

00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:18.240
Some people are born with a silver spoon.

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:20.200
They're even finding ways

00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:22.560
to pass on this blessing
to their children and grandchildren.

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.520
But some people…

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.880
have to suffer and be poor.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.440
Suffer and be poor?

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.760
Sir, your complexion is rosy,

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.120
and you are in good health.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.000
You don't look ill.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.680
My ancestors were all officials,

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:52.120
but I've failed the exams every time.

00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280
It wasn't until middle age

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.560
that I finally became a scholar.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.320
But the good times didn't last long.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.320
I see that I'm getting old.

00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.040
How can I be content with that?

00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:14.600
I must stay in this world
for a while longer to enjoy

00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.520
my hard-earned power and wealth.

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.720
But life always comes to an end.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:28.400
Even if you're greedy,
it can't go on forever.

00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.840
Unless you wish for longevity.

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.200
Of course.

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.440
Why can't I wish for longevity?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.320
This is my only wish in this life.

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.560
No matter how much I have to pay,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.600
I'll make it come true.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400
That's right.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.800
In this world, everything is unfair.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:54.640
I was born beautiful.

00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.280
As I grew, my beauty outshone all
within 10 miles around.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:03.040
But this year, some new bride appeared.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.080
Everyone says she's prettier than me!

00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.800
I was the number-one beauty.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.680
She stole my title so easily.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:17.480
Of course, I'm not happy about it.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.080
As long as I can defeat her,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.160
I would give up my life.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.000
I'm going to have a son.

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.520
I'm going to have a son!

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:51.520
Thank you, Dr. Gu.

00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.560
I'm going to have a son!

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.920
Sir, my master will see you now.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.520
The problem with fertility
should be easy to deal with.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.240
But what about this elder's wish?

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:18.120
How can a person live forever?

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.200
We'll see when he comes out.

00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.120
Thank you.

00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.400
Although I can't live forever,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:37.240
my position

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.520
could just as well last for centuries.

00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:47.840
That's enough.

00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.400
It'll last for centuries!

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.000
It's enough.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.520
It's enough.

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:00.840
Young Master.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.360
What do you think
they talked about in there?

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:05.480
Why do I find this
more and more suspicious?

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.680
What about me?

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.400
It's getting dark. Am I next?

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.040
Please be patient.

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.840
- This way, please.
- Let's go.

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.960
You don't seem to be in a hurry.

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.800
Everything has its own way.

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:30.400
First-come, first-served.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.520
There's no point in rushing.

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:44.640
Be careful.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:48.640
- I'm the most beautiful woman now.
- Be careful.

00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:52.160
That's right. I'm the prettiest.

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:53.400
Please be careful.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.840
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920
I'm the prettiest.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.040
- I'm the most beautiful one.
- Please watch your step.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.600
Take care.

00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:10.760
Although you came together,
my master only sees the sick.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.480
Which one of you wants to see the doctor?

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.040
She'll go.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:20.440
Me?

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:26.480
Go ahead. I'll wait for you.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.120
Please follow me.

00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:45.800
Aren't you afraid, Young Master?

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.120
Afraid of what?

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:55.480
I heard that there's a price
for Dr. Gu's treatment.

00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.800
Aren't you afraid
that your wife will make a decision

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:59.040
while keeping you in the dark?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.600
I'm not afraid.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:01.880
Why is that?

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:05.640
Because you're the dangerous one.

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:27.600
Dr. Gu.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.000
Why are you here?

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:33.480
I don't know.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.480
I just found out that I'm sick.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.760
That's why I came to see you first.

00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.160
You don't even know what's wrong with you.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.880
You don't want anything.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.080
Why would you come here?

00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:49.760
Forget it.

00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.200
Let me check.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:11.760
There's something fishy
about your illness.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.280
Fishy?

00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:15.440
You can't tell what's wrong with me?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.920
Maybe it's because fate does not bind us.

00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.400
If our encounter is not meant to be,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.600
why did you go through so much trouble

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.440
to become an old lady and lure us here?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.680
Miss.

00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.920
Prying is not a good habit.

00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.040
I'm just an annoying person.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.320
I'm going to find out the truth!

00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:51.280
What's going on?

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.200
What do you mean?

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:04.400
The "doctor" inside is just a puppet.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.280
It can't do any harm.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.800
You're the one behind all of this.

00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:14.000
When did you find out?

00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.040
The moment I came in.

00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:30.720
Sir, my master would like to see you.

00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.560
You beguile people under the guise
of the Zhu Yu herb.

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:39.560
What's in it for you?

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.920
You're wrong.

00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:42.800
I didn't mean to deceive them.

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.200
It's just that you want something from me.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.240
If you didn't desperately want
the Zhu Yu herb,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:50.320
you wouldn't have been
brought here so easily.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:55.960
You mean you do have the Zhu Yu herb?

00:17:57.720 --> 00:17:58.720
Yes.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.560
Zhu Yu herb really lives up
to its reputation.

00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:49.800
But as I said, everything has a price.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:52.360
Those who wish
to fulfill their greedy desires

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.680
must pay with something
even more precious.

00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:57.040
Something more precious?

00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.680
Do you remember the middle-aged man
who asked for a son?

00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.480
I'm going to have a son!

00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:04.200
I'm going to have a son!

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:06.720
Yes, he's going to have a son.

00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.760
But the day the son is born

00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:10.800
will be the day
his family's legacy collapses.

00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:15.440
As for that old man,
so what if he lives forever?

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.000
It's enough.

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680
He's riddled with diseases.

00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.880
One might find death a swifter release.

00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:27.600
As for the lady
who wanted to change her appearance,

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:29.200
I took her eyes.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.760
Despite her dazzling beauty,
she can't see anymore.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:36.640
You lunatic.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.840
Lunatic?

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:40.160
If I'm crazy, what about the world?

00:19:40.760 --> 00:19:41.920
In order to achieve their goals,

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.960
they're just as crazy,
only they don't even see it.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.280
Everyone who comes here

00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.240
is willing to do anything
to get what they want.

00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:51.960
What about you?

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:57.000
If I treat your wife,

00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.720
what price are you willing to pay?

00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:03.840
Don't you dare touch her.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:05.160
Don't worry.

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.280
I'm not interested in killing people.

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:11.920
But it's rare to meet a smart person.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.760
How about playing a game with me?

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.480
Sure.

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.840
What are we playing?

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:24.080
I take good care of the plants
in the yard.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.040
I'll give you some time.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.080
If you can find the most precious plant,

00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.440
I'll treat you for free.
What do you think?

00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520
All right.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.760
Medical Record

00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:50.480
Young Master, you're so stupid.

00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.600
This is just a common pine tree.

00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.280
No.

00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:59.280
This is the most precious one
in this garden.

00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:02.400
What do you mean?

00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:06.520
Aside from this, everything else is fake.

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.960
Are you a Celestial Master?

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:47.120
Yes, you demon.

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.600
You've deceived so many people
all these years.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.400
Herb Demon

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.160
Take me if you can.

00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.120
But it won't do you any good.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240
Because…

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.400
Because he's not just any demon.

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.800
Are you all right?

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:19.760
I found this.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.280
What's this?

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.520
It's a medical record he wrote.

00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:26.680
Am I right, Zhu Yu herb?

00:23:28.360 --> 00:23:30.000
I don't need this anymore.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.480
Why did you take it?

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:36.600
From the medical report you wrote,
I can see that you were once a healer.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:38.440
You treated people sincerely.

00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:41.640
But how did you end up like this?

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.200
A healer?

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:47.640
This so-called "healer"
is nothing but a fool's dream.

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:49.400
As for sincerity,

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.920
sincerity is worthless to these people.

00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:00.320
Years ago,
I was just a plant.

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.840
I was taken care of.

00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:04.800
My master took care of me every day.

00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:08.200
I hoped that one day,
I could attain spiritual cognition

00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.440
so that I could treat illnesses
and save people.

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.640
He said all living things are suffering.

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:17.720
Since I could trace illnesses
to their root and cure all ailments,

00:24:18.440 --> 00:24:19.440
I shouldn't let my gift go to waste.

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:24.040
Unfortunately,
my cultivation was still limited,

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:26.040
and I couldn't take human form.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:27.800
He said it was okay.

00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:28.960
He would wait for me.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.560
I believed him.

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.880
But when I turned into a human,

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.760
I found out…

00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.920
that I had been abandoned.

00:24:43.200 --> 00:24:44.720
There was no one in the mansion.

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.360
My master never came back for me.

00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:59.880
I left Chang'an in sadness
and came to Quzhou…

00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.600
to practice medicine and save lives.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.320
However, I gradually realized

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.200
these people don't deserve to be saved.

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:10.080
All living beings suffer?

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:12.720
This is clearly their retribution.

00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560
Yes.

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.880
You saw it too.

00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.680
In the first few years,
I treated every patient with all my heart.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:23.120
And yet, in the end…

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:31.720
No consultation fee

00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.520
No consultation fee?

00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:35.360
Is this true?

00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.040
Could he be a swindler?

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.360
How good is this physician?

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.840
Didn't you see him here before?

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:42.040
I'm just along for the ride.

00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.280
There's no charge anyway.

00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:44.440
It'd be a waste not to see the doctor.

00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.280
Was he the one who cured the sores

00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:48.600
on your tongue?

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000
Not necessarily.

00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:52.200
Even if
I didn't take the medicine he prescribed,

00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.600
I'd still get better after some time.

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:54.680
Let's go and have a drink.

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:55.760
Let's go!

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:56.920
Come on.

00:25:58.040 --> 00:25:59.720
I've always wanted to save the world.

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.160
I didn't care about the money.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:03.360
But they didn't believe me.

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.920
I traveled everywhere
to diagnose them one by one.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.680
I thought they would believe me
as long as they recovered.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:10.520
If word spread,

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.160
I'll become a famous physician
in the city.

00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.200
But even when I did my best,

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:22.400
those people weren't satisfied.

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:35.080
After my child took your medicine
yesterday,

00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:36.200
he vomited and had diarrhea at night.

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:37.680
Spill! Is something wrong
with your medicine?

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.520
- Tell me!
- That's impossible.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:42.840
- Did that child eat too much cold food?
- My father too!

00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.200
You said he would recover
at the beginning of the year.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.520
But yesterday…

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:49.400
- He passed away yesterday!
- You're a quack.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:51.800
Pay up! Pay up!

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:54.320
No. That elderly man
was advanced in years.

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:56.120
After all, human life has its limits.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.880
- Give me back my father!
- Try lying again, you quack!

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.600
You're a quack!

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160
Let's go.

00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:11.480
Life and death
are decided by fate.

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.080
Even doctors can't do anything about it.

00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.000
I treated patients and saved them
without expecting anything in return.

00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.360
But they bullied me.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:23.480
It dawned on me

00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.920
that their greed was simply
for the freedom to act as they wished.

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.680
So I set them up.

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:31.200
I made them pay dearly.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.880
They knew the consequences.

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.800
But for their greed,
they wanted things heedlessly.

00:27:36.880 --> 00:27:38.680
They were grateful to me.

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:42.280
It's their fault
for treating you that way.

00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:44.960
But you shouldn't let the small picture
blind you to the whole.

00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.440
Can you honestly claim that

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:48.520
no one ever came to you sincerely
for help after that?

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:50.560
Why do those innocent people

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.280
have to suffer on behalf of the bullies?

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.000
Innocent people?

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.680
They just haven't shown their true colors.

00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:00.680
What's wrong with making the first move?

00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.520
Everyone has something
they can't let go of.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.520
Some will spend their lives
chasing what they can't let go of.

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.600
Still, that's no reason
to harm anyone else.

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.600
You sure are good with words, little lady.

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:17.240
It's a pity that you saw through my plan.

00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.760
Otherwise, I would've made
you pay with your words.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.160
Die!

00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.560
Wu Zhen.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.720
Wu Zhen.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:49.240
That was Cat Lord's power.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:50.800
Who is she?

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:52.520
How do you know Cat Lord?

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.880
Cat Lord was the one who raised me.

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:03.360
Are you talking about the former Cat Lord?

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.040
Former?

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.840
Where is he now?

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.640
He passed away 18 years ago.

00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.640
He's passed away?

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.160
He's dead?

00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.960
Eighteen years ago, many died
in the Heavenly Fire Disaster in Chang'an.

00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.560
The former Cat Lord died saving the world.

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.400
No wonder the house was empty.

00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.520
No wonder he didn't come back for me.

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.320
He didn't abandon me.

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.400
He was already dead.

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.040
It's all my fault.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.520
Why is it your fault?

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.400
It's my fault
that my spiritual power is too weak.

00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:01.040
It's my fault that I couldn't do anything.

00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.240
If I had taken human form earlier,

00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:03.960
I might have been able to save him.

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:09.480
It's all my fault.

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.480
We can't change things.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.840
It's all predestined.

00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.280
Even if you were there for him,
you couldn't have changed the outcome.

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.200
But there's still a long way to go.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.400
Some things can't be pursued.

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.920
But… some things can be undone.

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:08.760
Where's the demon?

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.120
He's realized his mistake.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.640
He's in his true form now.

00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:28.160
When I get better,

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:31.640
you don't have to worry about me anymore.

00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:06.120
Little Celestial Master.

00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:08.800
I have to tell you something.

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240
What is it?

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:13.640
I can't save your wife.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:15.480
She's not sick.

00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:18.040
It's her calamity.

00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.680
I'll give you my original body.

00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:23.720
When the time comes,

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.360
I might be useful.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.640
I heard that it wasn't easy

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.280
for you to take care of the spa
and hot spring incidents.

00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:27.840
Now, you're learning arithmetic.

00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:30.160
Lady Liu, you know me well.

00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.480
I'm just making preparations.

00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:35.560
In case it happens again,
I don't want to get in your way.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.040
There won't be a next time.

00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:39.640
Oh.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.120
Were you waiting for me?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.240
Do you want to play with me?

00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:52.240
- No.
- Come on.

00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.120
Please.

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.560
Lady Liu, this is the place.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.600
Why did you bring me here?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:10.680
I want to show you something interesting.

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.040
Have a seat.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.200
Lady Liu, I learned a new spell
in the past two days.

00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.680
Take a look.

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.920
I…

00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:44.520
I really did learn a new spell.

00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:48.040
I'll do it again.

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:49.600
Mmm.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:19.880
Isn't it beautiful?

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.200
Mm-hmm.

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:28.440
Come out.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.120
Come out? What do you mean?

00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:34.560
Xuan Hui.

00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:36.120
Xuan Hui?

00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.560
Where's Xuan Hui?

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160
I don't see Xuan Hui.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:41.480
It's almost winter.

00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.840
Where are the fireflies from?

00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.680
I think they're immortal fireflies.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.000
They're demons
with a bit of demonic power.

00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.640
If it wasn't for Xuan Hui,
how could you control them?

00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.200
I told you, we can't fool her.

00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:06.440
Besides, Snake Lord

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:08.440
has been cold-hearted for centuries.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:09.800
She wouldn't enjoy this.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.160
I think Lady Liu liked it, though.

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:16.920
It's dark and windy.

00:36:17.080 --> 00:36:18.840
It's normal to see hallucinations.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.320
I did like it.

00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:44.000
Are you two…

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.080
Xuan Hui.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:50.160
Huh?

00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:51.720
Come here.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:53.840
What's the matter?

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:55.760
Grandpa.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:57.480
Grandpa.

00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.840
It's inappropriate for you to sit here.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:01.160
Stand up.

00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:05.480
How can "Grandpa" be on his feet?

00:37:08.840 --> 00:37:09.840
You…

00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.080
Xuan Hui.

00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:14.800
- Huh?
- You've been in Chang'an for months.

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.560
You can't possibly go on
wasting your days like this.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.360
You had two days of fun at Mei Manor,

00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:21.360
and then stayed another two
at the Liu manor.

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.200
Find something to do.

00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:27.000
I'm not "wasting my days".

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:29.440
I've never stopped my daily cultivation.

00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:33.440
Besides,
I've been cultivating for centuries.

00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:35.960
If you hadn't locked me up
in the Demon Prison,

00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.760
I would have turned into a Yinglong

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:39.080
and gone to heaven and earth.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:40.400
I'd stir up the wind and clouds.

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.560
I'd be so cool.

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.640
Are you blaming me
for your failure to turn into a Yinglong?

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.880
That's how it is.

00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:53.680
Even though Snake Lord did me wrong

00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:55.760
but still refused to apologize to me,

00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.040
I'm going to turn into a dragon anyway.

00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:02.120
When the time comes,
I'll fly in the clouds and leave Chang'an.

00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.280
Why would I hold a grudge
against a little snake like you?

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.480
Am I right?

00:38:05.560 --> 00:38:06.560
Fine.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.080
I'll wait and see how you'll go
to heaven and earth

00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:11.560
and fly in the clouds.

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160
- Grandpa.
- Hm?

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.200
I believe you'll turn into a Yinglong.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.160
- Xuan Hui.
- Huh?

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.960
You called me "a little snake,"
didn't you?

00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:24.480
Yeah.

00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:50.600
It's so beautiful.

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.800
You can take a nap if you're sleepy.

00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:32.000
You're just a mortal.
You stayed up all night.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.600
It's normal that you can't take it.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.880
I'm fine.

00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.840
I can hold on.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.880
Lady Liu, you must be thirsty.

00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160
Have some water.

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:56.560
Here.

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.960
