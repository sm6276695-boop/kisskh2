00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.040
Wang Yu.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:11.840
You're right.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.080
You win.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.280
Name your terms.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.240
What will it take to let her go?

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.240
You remember now?

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.520
Yes.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.480
She is my wife.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.840
She loves me the most.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.920
And she's the one I love most.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.520
Please, let her go.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.120
Yasin.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.520
I've missed you so much.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.240
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.280
Sorry.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.720
I'm sorry.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.120
You're finally back.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.670
I'm sorry.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.840
You're finally back.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.880
I remember now.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.560
How's it going?

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.560
Just like you wanted,

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.400
it's all done.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.600
I've waited so long for you.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.720
Also,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640
Han Xu remembered.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.000
Alright.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.400
I remember Xiao Ran used

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.240
to tell me to get you to quit smoking,

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.280
but I never once said it to you.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.760
Thanks for telling me.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.280
Don't worry.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.200
I'll complete the task

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.600
you asked me to.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.760
You're not Wang Yu.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.480
Who are you?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.000
Sorry, Chief Han.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.320
Long time no see.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.200
My bad.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.360
Just messing with you.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.360
Wang Yu told you to do this, right?

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.200
Where is he?

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.740
Ask him to come and talk to me.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.040
Wishing you forever happiness.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040
A perfect match for life.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.320
Was someone hurt?

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.440
Boss Jiu is gone.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.520
Wang Yu's target isn't me.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.800
What is he after?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:15.480
I'm making Nuo

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.120
my daughter,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.720
so she can suffer

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.600
every bit of pain I've been through.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.560
Pendant.

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.520
Where's Nuo?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.280
What pendant?

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:26.660
- Nuo's fine.
- What happened?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.400
She skipped school.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.520
Someone's protecting her.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.360
I never gave her

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:31.600
a cartoon pendant.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.200
It must've been Wang Yu
pretending to be me.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:35.680
So,

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.760
the formula might be hidden inside.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.260
He wants to use Wang Mingcheng
to hurt Nuo.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.880
Let's go.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.680
Sister Hui.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.720
I want to buy Dad a gift.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.280
- Is that okay?
- Sure.

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:05.240
How about this place?

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.160
Okay.

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.920
Boss, I've seen it.

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.800
That thing is hanging
on the little girl's neck.

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:39.960
Each one has betrayed me.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.280
Has he been found?

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.000
Boss, Boss.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.320
Found him?

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:56.460
No.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:57.520
But someone sent a letter.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.600
It's addressed to you.

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.660
(Godfather, long time no see.)

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.860
(Want the formula?
It's inside this pendant.)

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.720
Dad once gave me a pink one.

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:25.360
I want to give him a blue one.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:26.520
Okay, no problem.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.080
Let's go.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.640
Here.

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:45.460
Hello.

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.960
Miss, I want to buy this.

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:48.790
- Please wrap it.
- Sure.

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:50.240
Sure, let me get you a bag for that.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.580
- Okay?
- Sure.

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.920
Please take this.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.360
Where's Nuo?

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:01.480
She's here with me.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.640
Get her back to the station now.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:04.600
Got it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.160
Back then, to save me,

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.520
you fell with Wang Yu.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.840
Before that happened,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:16.120
he was very unstable.

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.120
He told us a lot

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:20.960
about your childhood,

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.100
what happened to him
after he met Wang Mingcheng,

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:27.040
his love for Xiao Ran,

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.640
and his hatred toward you.

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.000
You fell unconscious.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.440
The guilt was crushing.

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.120
It made you lose your memory

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.440
and caused severe cognitive confusion.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.920
You always wished you could

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.000
take his pain for him.

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.440
When I was little,

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520
my mom told me

00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:56.880
I once had a high fever,

00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.800
but she told me

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.880
it was just a regular cold.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:04.720
Only now do I realize

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.960
that it was all my fault.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:10.560
I made my younger brother

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.160
go through so much pain.

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.240
But I somehow forgot it all.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.200
That's selective amnesia.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.640
You were a kid back then.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.680
You couldn't handle that pain.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:27.800
And this time,

00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:30.960
I even forgot about you.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.800
I was such an awful man.

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:35.800
I'm sorry.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:39.260
I'm just glad you're back.

00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:46.440
This is what Mr. An found.

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.540
See if there's any lead.

00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.580
(An Shaocong's Report)

00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.290
What's wrong?

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:59.800
Chief, someone's attacking us.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.040
Protect Nuo. I'm on my way.

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:03.000
Hurry.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:24.440
No need to be scared.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.280
Have you played hide-and-seek?

00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:29.120
We're playing hide-and-seek now.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:29.960
Okay?

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:56.520
Don't move.

00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.600
Stop right there.

00:10:58.700 --> 00:10:59.550
Freeze.

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.560
Don't run.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.400
Everyone, freeze.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.640
Luckily, you made it in time.

00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:06.580
You're not hurt, right?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.360
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:12.680
Hold on.

00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:14.280
Let me explain to Nuo first.

00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:17.680
Nuo.

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:29.760
Thank you both.

00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.120
No need.

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.120
Nuo.

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.440
Remember our promise?

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.440
Yes. Dad is a narcotics officer.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.760
I have to pretend not to know Dad

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.120
to keep him safe.

00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:50.960
Han Shuyang.

00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.880
The game's over now.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.720
I've always treated it as my amulet.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.840
Now, I want you to have it.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:05.800
Don't bother him.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:08.280
Your daughter?

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.280
Yes, Nuo is eight now.

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:12.600
Nuo, go back to your room.

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.400
- Mom, I want...
- Be good.

00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:16.000
Doctor Chen.

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:16.960
I have to go.

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.840
I have to pretend not to know Dad

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.320
to keep him safe.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:24.800
Dad!

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.420
Nuo.

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.080
Get in the car.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.000
Hurry.

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.320
What were you thinking?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.880
You said you'd get revenge.

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.560
Then you just disappeared.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.290
I've been looking for you.

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:28.760
Do you know how hard it's been?

00:13:30.210 --> 00:13:31.060
And what did you do?

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:32.760
You sent me a random photo

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.200
and led me to that awful place.

00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:35.560
All my people are gone.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.840
The formula is in your head, right?

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:39.560
You should've come back sooner

00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:41.120
to save me all this trouble.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.080
Godfather.

00:13:52.560 --> 00:13:54.360
Of course, I have my reasons.

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.440
If I don't lure you over there
