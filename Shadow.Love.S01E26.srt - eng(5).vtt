[Episode 26]

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:45.950
I need water...

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.120
Servants...

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.680
It's too hot.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.710
Servants...

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.260
Servants...

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.920
Servants...

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.710
Greetings,

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.150
Father.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.360
May you

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.750
stay in good health.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.150
Today

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.610
is Li's burial day.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.430
You couldn't see him off
on his final journey.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.860
In heaven,

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.150
he must feel it's a pity.

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:03.430
After all,

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.590
he was your most beloved son.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.750
Why was Li

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.680
killed in Lucheng?

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.140
You proclaimed to the world

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.550
that he was murdered by the man in black.

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.000
But he's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.120
just a nobody from jianghu—

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.650
how could he possibly have the courage

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.920
to murder Prince Li?

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.730
Father, please don't be angry.

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.490
You mustn't harm your health.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.430
The entire imperial palace

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.310
is busy with

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.630
Li's funeral.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.360
I have deployed

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.650
all your attendants elsewhere.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.700
Let me

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.770
personally serve you your medicine.

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.300
You and Li were never on good terms.

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:19.959
Can you truly say

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.920
his death

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:23.880
has nothing to do

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.680
with you?

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:28.950
Li, Li…

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.270
Why is he the only one in your heart?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.680
All these years,

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:35.659
I have served you devotedly,
swallowing every humiliation.

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:38.060
Haven't I earned
even a shred of your trust?

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.270
Or is it that, in your eyes,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.670
the one who should have died in Lucheng

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.600
was me?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.020
My mother was of humble birth,

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.320
never gained your favor,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.000
and died young in sorrow.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.280
Though I was born a prince,

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.310
I grew up having to

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.960
tread carefully around others.

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.120
Even the lowliest eunuchs

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.920
sought to trample me underfoot.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.510
But then,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.560
you suddenly

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.630
had me serve at your side

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.360
and even named me Crown Prince.

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:18.610
Do you know how overjoyed I was then?

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:20.430
I thought

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:21.680
you finally remembered

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.160
our father-son bond

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:25.040
and wanted to make amends to me.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:30.670
But what was the truth?

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:33.240
I was nothing but a pawn,

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.540
to be sacrificed when the fated day comes,

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680
my life exchanged

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:40.990
for your eternal reign.

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.800
So you knew this all along?

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:53.830
That year,
I unfortunately fell into the water.

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.800
Someone rescued me,
but I had a persistent high fever.

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.950
You stayed by my side the entire night,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.070
holding my hand and saying to me—

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:02.360
Yang.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.720
Yang.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:05.630
Father...

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:07.070
I'm here.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:09.630
Father,

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.800
I'm so scared.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.750
Father,

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.040
can you stay with me a little longer?

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.000
Don't be afraid.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.510
I'm here. I'm here.

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:19.440
Don't be afraid.

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.610
Don't be afraid.

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.720
Leave us.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.770
I...

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.730
am immortal,

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.530
the sovereign.

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:00.580
I

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.480
won't let you die.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:04.670
I forbid you to die!

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.630
I want you

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.720
to live well.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.800
In that moment,

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:14.440
were you afraid of losing

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:16.450
your own flesh and blood,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.670
or afraid of losing

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:21.830
the one who would face the calamity
for you?

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:44.070
You must not know

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.830
that the elixir you take daily

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:48.870
has long been laced by my brother

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:50.920
with a slow-acting poison.

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:53.070
After I die,

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.560
the next victim

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:57.380
will be you.

00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:46.550
You should eat something.

00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:51.130
I added blood ginseng

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.170
to this porridge,

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:55.020
which will sustain a bit
of your vital energy.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:56.630
Otherwise, you won't last long.

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.150
How confident are you about this?

00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.870
Why is it that

00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:01.200
you still can't remove the Jade Linglong?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.720
We've been trying all along
to purify your blood.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:06.360
We must first wash away
the blood pact between you and Li Shuang.

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.530
If it remains,

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.510
the Jade Linglong will continue
to take root within you,

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.370
and eventually
it will be impossible to remove.

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:13.890
So this is why

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.270
you said before that

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.630
I would forget Shuang

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:20.470
after the Jade Linglong is removed?

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:26.320
So what

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.200
if you forget her?

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:31.280
All attachments in this world

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.760
arise from fate.

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.780
If you and Li Shuang are destined,

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.670
you will certainly meet again.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.800
This hairpin

00:10:46.150 --> 00:10:48.480
was found beaside the quicksand that day.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:51.480
Perhaps Li Shuang,
believing she was certain to die,

00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:52.920
left it for you as a keepsake.

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.920
Now,

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:55.650
I'm returning it to you.

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.750
Let this memento remind you of her,

00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:06.640
and it may give you the strength
to live well.

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:07.990
Only by living

00:11:09.150 --> 00:11:11.080
is there a chance to meet her again.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:05.750
An imperial edict has arrived!

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.440
By the Mandate of Heaven,

00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.670
the Emperor decrees:

00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.320
The Crown Prince is kind-hearted

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.750
and filial.

00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:04.750
After my passing,

00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:06.870
he shall ascend the throne

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:08.810
in accordance with Heaven's will,

00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:09.950
relying on

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:11.630
divine blessing

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:13.000
to govern

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:14.520
the realms,

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.510
ensuring peace for generations.

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:19.790
So it is commanded!

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.480
I shall obey!

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:50.340
[World]

00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:20.840
I don't know
when I will lose control again.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:22.960
To be safe,

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:25.160
I should be locked up

00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:27.750
to prevent harm to the innocent.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.600
The more the Jade Linglong
merges with you,

00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.630
the more it will gradually
consume your will.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:33.670
One day,

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.140
you'll completely lose control

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.440
and become an emotionless killing machine.

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:38.760
By then,

00:14:39.010 --> 00:14:39.630

for an urgent matter.

00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:41.110
Congratulations, General.
Heaven has blessed you.

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.400
You are finally out of danger.

00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.290
I am here

00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.980
to deliver an imperial edict.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:47.160
Where is...

00:18:48.250 --> 00:18:49.340
His Highness?

00:18:50.670 --> 00:18:51.760
General, you've just woken up,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.340
so you are not to be blamed
for not knowing this.

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:54.340
His Majesty...

00:18:54.490 --> 00:18:56.080
has already returned to the capital.

00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:56.920
His Majesty?

00:18:57.370 --> 00:18:58.880
While you were unconscious,

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.530
His Majesty was deeply worried.

00:19:00.530 --> 00:19:02.790
He intended to stay here until you awoke,

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:04.370
but the late emperor suddenly fell ill,

00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.780
and he had to rush back to the capital
to handle state affairs.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.440
Now His Majesty has ascended to the throne

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.750
and unified the realm.

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:12.220
He ordered me
to take care of you here and,

00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:13.500
once you recover,

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:14.740
to immediately

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:16.430
bring you to the capital.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.440
I still have an urgent matter to attend to

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.030
and cannot return to the capital
right away.

00:19:35.030 --> 00:19:36.510
Please convey this message to him.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:38.960
His Majesty is grateful
for your life-saving deed

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:41.100
and has always regarded you
as the most important person to him,

00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:42.050
unwilling for you to be constrained

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.040
by the formalities of ruler and subject.

00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:45.550
Yet after all,
he is the sovereign of a nation;

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:46.680
his word is law.

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:49.570
If you insist on disobeying, wouldn't it

00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:51.720
be considered defying an imperial order?

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.720
Since you know His Majesty
is grateful to me,

00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:55.000
you should understand

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.790
that whether or not it counts
as defying an imperial order

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.120
is not for you to decide.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:00.560
After I finish my business,

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:02.310
I will personally request punishment
from His Majesty.

00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.960
General,

00:20:03.340 --> 00:20:04.800
you must think carefully!

00:20:05.030 --> 00:20:06.440
As a frontier general,

00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.550
leaving your post without permission

00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:10.030
is treason
that implicates your entire clan.

00:20:10.030 --> 00:20:10.790
Moreover,

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:12.200
to pursue Jin'an,

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:14.530
the fugitive who assassinated Prince Li,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:17.130
it is not necessary for you
to act personally.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.150
Once you return to the capital
and meet His Majesty,

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:20.480
the fate of the criminal

00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:22.680
will be determined by imperial decree.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:27.450
Miss Lu, please take care of the General.

00:20:27.550 --> 00:20:29.400
I will arrange everything.

00:20:29.590 --> 00:20:30.310
Soon,

00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:31.800
we will be ready to depart.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:43.330
This Su Muyang.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.720
He owes you and Jin'an a great deal.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200
But what did he do?

00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.850
He threatened you instead.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:51.790
Shuang,

00:20:52.250 --> 00:20:53.530
if you trust me,

00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:55.700
let me go to Wuling Mountain for you.

00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:57.400
No way.

00:20:57.790 --> 00:20:58.640
That Mo Yin

00:20:58.730 --> 00:20:59.860
acts suspiciously.

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:00.570
And we don't know whether the people

00:21:00.570 --> 00:21:01.550
of Wuling Mountain are good or evil.

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:03.350
It's too dangerous for you to go.

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:04.750
I've heard of

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.440
Wuling Mountain before.

00:21:07.110 --> 00:21:08.750
Though they are formidable,

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.720
most of them are devoted to medicine,

00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:13.160
obsessed with herbs and remedies.

00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:14.830
Surely

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.240
they aren't that malicious.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:19.510
But human nature is unpredictable.

00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.110
Indeed.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:22.750
That damn Mo Yin

00:21:22.850 --> 00:21:23.840
pretended to be a good man

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:25.300
and completely fooled me.

00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:27.910
I must settle this score with him.

00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.000
I know you worry about Jin'an

00:21:34.270 --> 00:21:35.310
and about me,

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.960
but don't worry.

00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:39.240
I've faced death,

00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:41.020
so I value my life all the more.

00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:41.560
On this trip,

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.120
I will be careful in every step

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.050
and won't take unnecessary risks.

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.400
This is a Qianji Needle.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:00.910
If you encounter danger,

00:22:01.110 --> 00:22:02.000
press this button

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:02.790
on the syringe

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.520
and a poisonous needle will shoot out.

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:05.440
Carry it for self-defense.

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:06.970
Be cautious in everything.

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:08.470
Once I've arranged everything,

00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:10.670
I will go up the mountain to support you.

00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:15.970
Remember,

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:18.370
do not point the syringe at yourself.

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:49.900
The Jade Linglong still can't be removed.

00:22:50.590 --> 00:22:52.390
What exactly is going wrong?

00:22:52.540 --> 00:22:53.920
If this continues,

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.770
I'm afraid Jin'an might...

00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.760
No.

00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.500
I must find another method

00:22:59.530 --> 00:23:01.130
to remove the Jade Linglong.

00:23:35.750 --> 00:23:37.960
They even have such rare herbs here?

00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:56.510
Wuling Mountain?

00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.100
Stop!

00:24:23.650 --> 00:24:24.060
Wuling Mountain is a restricted area.

00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:24.700
[Wuling Mountain]

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:26.100
Outsiders may not enter.

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:28.160
Well...

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:29.630
My Lords.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:31.400
I need to see your master
for an urgent matter.

00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:33.530
Please make an exception and let me in.

00:24:33.830 --> 00:24:34.790
The Master is in seclusion.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:35.620
He is seeing no one.

00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:36.550
If you're here for medicine,

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.510
please go back.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:39.240
My Lord, you misunderstood me.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.400
I'm a doctor myself.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.930
I don't need your medicine.

00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:45.310
This matter concerns Wuling Mountain.

00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:46.440
If we miss the timing,

00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.770
it could be disastrous.

00:24:49.270 --> 00:24:50.070
Please leave.

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.460
Mo Yin, come out!

00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.650
Miss.

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.880
Wuling Mountain
has remained secluded for generations

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:08.070
and does not interact with outsiders.

00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:10.000
If you insist on pestering us,

00:25:10.130 --> 00:25:11.310
don't blame us for being unkind.

00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:13.110
Secluded for generations?

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.240
If that was true,

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:17.690
then where did the child in my womb
come from?

00:25:17.690 --> 00:25:18.910
Child?

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.070
Are you saying

00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:23.720
you and the Master...

00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.210
Don't bring up that faithless man with me.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.110
In Lucheng,

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:30.310
we had a romance,

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.420
and he promised to spend his life with me.

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.480
But as soon as I became pregnant,

00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.200
he left

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.440
without a word.

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:43.770
No, that's not right.

00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.350
You can't make such a claim without proof.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:46.790
Just because you say the child
is the Master's,

00:25:46.790 --> 00:25:47.990
doesn't make it true.

00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:51.110
You have a point.

00:25:55.030 --> 00:25:57.830
This is the last keepsake he left me.

00:25:58.800 --> 00:26:00.000
The Clear Moon Pearl?

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.030
Could it be true?

00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.190
Mo Yin...

00:26:07.310 --> 00:26:08.750
Miss, are you alright?

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:10.490
Morning sickness.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:12.480
Well...

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:14.960
Be careful.

00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:24.920
Master,

00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:26.970
I have an urgent matter to report.

00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:29.350
Haven't I told you?

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:31.310
During my seclusion,

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:32.590
no one is to disturb me.

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:33.480
This is an emergency.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:35.410
We have no choice but to inform you.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.160
Come in.

00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:42.440
Master,

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:44.590
there's a young lady
requesting to see you.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:45.160
She claims

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.400
to be from Lucheng.

00:26:47.110 --> 00:26:47.920
Lucheng?

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.080
What else did she say?

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.960
She said

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:53.240
she has

00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:54.030
some past

00:26:54.030 --> 00:26:54.720
with you.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.550
And she carries

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.450
your Clear Moon Pearl with her.

00:27:20.890 --> 00:27:21.750
This way, Miss.

00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:50.410
Miss.

00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.550
You may leave now.

00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.110
Master Mo,

00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.080
at the General's Residence,

00:28:25.170 --> 00:28:26.370
Shuang may not

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:28.790
have shown you the utmost care,

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:30.600
but she was at least courteous.

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:32.150
But what did you do?

00:28:32.150 --> 00:28:33.310
You tore her and her lover apart

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.910
and seriously injured them.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:36.200
Before, I thought

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.880
you were just unpredictable

00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.940
but at least a righteous gentleman.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.070
Now I see

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.240
I was blind.

00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:48.660
Since you've come here,

00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:50.900
I assume Miss Li

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.000
has told you everything in detail.

00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:57.760
What I did

00:28:58.370 --> 00:28:59.570
was out of necessity.

00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.800
It was clearly all fake righteousness.

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:02.940
Where is Jin'an?

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:03.870
I want to see him.

00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:10.110
Jin'an is weak

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.820
and shouldn't receive visitors.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:14.790
Weak?

00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:17.510
Then I want to see
just how weak he really is.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.830
I have no obligation to explain

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.580
the affairs of Wuling Mountain to you.

00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.830
Outsiders are not allowed
on Wuling Mountain.

00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:25.360
Please leave immediately.

00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:32.430
I promised Shuang

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.100
I would keep Jin'an safe.

00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:37.710
If I don't see that he's well,

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.640
even if I die here,

00:29:41.070 --> 00:29:43.920
I'll become a vengeful ghost to haunt you.

00:29:44.660 --> 00:29:46.260
I never bow to threats.

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.820
Miss Lu, you should stop

00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:53.600
these little tricks.

00:30:09.510 --> 00:30:10.880
Weren't you afraid I'd just stand by

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.160
and watch you die?

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.680
I... I was so scared.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.850
I thought I was surely done for.

00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:24.090
I was not afraid!

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:29.240
If you truly didn't care
about people's lives,

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:30.730
you wouldn't have saved me

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:32.240
by the river that day.

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:51.630
How did you get so badly injured?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:01.130
How is Shuang?

00:31:01.750 --> 00:31:03.160
She's fine. Don't worry.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.960
Stop talking.

00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:06.170
Your inner breath is in chaos,

00:31:06.170 --> 00:31:07.480
and your pulse is dangerously weak.

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.880
An ordinary person would've died already.

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.890
Take a deep breath.

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:15.110
I'll use acupuncture
to stabilize your condition first.

00:31:15.550 --> 00:31:17.090
Do you even know
what kind of injury he has?

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.590
How dare you use acupuncture on him
so rashly?

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:19.790
If he dies,

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:21.520
how will you explain yourself?

00:31:22.350 --> 00:31:23.750
I should be asking you.

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.000
What on earth did you do to him

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.440
to make him like this?

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.770
Removing the Jade Linglong

00:31:28.770 --> 00:31:30.090
is no easy task.

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:33.000
He was already prepared for this.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:37.230
Now that you've seen him,

00:31:37.690 --> 00:31:39.160
you should go down the mountain now

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:40.960
and report to Shuang that he's safe.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:42.680
He's barely alive,

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:45.000
and you want me to report he's safe?

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.360
Your medical skills are excellent.

00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.240
You even cured

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.940
Su Muyang's strange poison
with your stupid bugs.

00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.180
I will not leave

00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.270
until I see him recover.

00:31:54.270 --> 00:31:55.200
This is a serious matter.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:57.200
It's not a time
for your childish stubbornness.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:57.920
Guards!

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.240
Take Miss Lu...

00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:00.110
Wuling Mountain's rules are strict.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:02.030
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.310
Don't you want to know

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.030
why they allowed me up here?

00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.590
I'm pregnant. With twins. They're yours.

00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.220
How dare you speak such nonsense
and ruin my reputation?

00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:18.120
You're a man. What are you afraid of?

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.140
If you don't want tales
of your romantic escapades

00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.180
spreading all over Wuling Mountain,

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:21.290
then let me stay

00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.160
and watch you treat him.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:24.160
Otherwise,

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.670
I'll easily make up a dozen stories

00:32:25.670 --> 00:32:27.350
like this without effort.

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.710
Also...

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:31.190
You!

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.260
Are you here begging for medicine again?

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.270
I made a grave mistake.

00:33:16.550 --> 00:33:18.480
I'm willing to accept any punishment.

00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.240
Your Majesty...

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.590
Just kill yourself.

00:33:25.550 --> 00:33:26.550
Didn't you say before

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:29.010
that you wouldn't dare
die without my order?

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.190
Today, I've given that order,

00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:33.900
so you have no more worries.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.430
You're not so useless

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.880
that you can't even die, are you?

00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:54.720
You were useless before,

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.270
and now you can't even accomplish
the smallest task.

00:34:00.030 --> 00:34:01.550
Where is

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:04.400
the shadow puppet

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:06.190
you promised to bring me?

00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.080
Instead of letting you waste away living,

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:17.830
perhaps today I should show mercy

00:34:18.250 --> 00:34:21.330
and release you from this

00:34:21.570 --> 00:34:23.300
utterly miserable existence.

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.949
After all, a useless person

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.030
will always be useless.

00:34:33.670 --> 00:34:34.710
Your Majesty,

00:34:35.550 --> 00:34:38.360
for the sake of my loyalty to you…

00:34:38.590 --> 00:34:40.150
Are you loyal to me...

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:43.570
or to the Brain-Devouring Powder?

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:47.620
I...

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.150
Many people want to be loyal to me.

00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.150
A worthless person like you

00:34:52.630 --> 00:34:55.840
has never deserved to serve by my side.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.440
I don't deserve it?

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.730
For all these years,

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.630
I've done my utmost
for every order you gave.

00:35:28.150 --> 00:35:29.070
Without me,

00:35:30.110 --> 00:35:32.000
would you be where you are today?

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:37.550
I gave up my dignity,

00:35:38.630 --> 00:35:40.510
my future,

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.230
and everything
that comes with being human,

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:47.310
just to stay by your side.

00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:50.360
Why can't you grant me

00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.190
even this small request?

00:35:57.440 --> 00:35:59.190
It was through my schemes and efforts

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:02.390
that Yu and I gradually ascended
to the highest position.

00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:03.800
Everything I have today

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:06.170
is what I deserve.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:12.190
Back then, Duan Aoze despised you so.

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:14.670
If I hadn't created
the Love-Binding Curse,

00:36:14.670 --> 00:36:17.470
how would you have become pregnant
with his child?

00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.230
That's what you owe me!

00:36:20.590 --> 00:36:21.930
Back then,
you betrayed your teacher and ancestors,

00:36:21.930 --> 00:36:23.360
willingly descending into ruin.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.670
It was I who saved your life,

00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:25.880
letting you barely cling
to existence until now.

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:27.110
Shut up!

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:35.750
Kill me! Kill me!

00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.720
I knew...

00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.540
you couldn't bring yourself to do it.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:53.540
Let me ask you—

00:36:56.830 --> 00:36:58.940
if I had met you earlier,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.890
would you have treated me the same way?

00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:15.800
Pathetic.

00:37:44.910 --> 00:37:46.140
Soon,

00:37:46.760 --> 00:37:49.880
I'll come to you
with the head of Duan Aodeng.

00:37:51.390 --> 00:37:52.440
Pathetic.
