[My Bias is Showing?!]

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.450
It's my first time filming a variety show,
so there were quite a few mistakes.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.300
I wonder if I've
caused any trouble for everyone.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.240
I'm sorry.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.970
What are you sorry for?

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.510
It's my first time, too.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.360
I'm really nervous, too.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.930
Would a professional
like you be nervous, too?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.230
That's interesting.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.000
It's the first recording today.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.480
If everything goes smoothly today,

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.830
shall we fulfil each other's wishes?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.730
W-Wish?

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.730
Is there anything you'd like me to do?

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:34.580
I...

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.650
I do have one.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420
You will...

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.770
agree to it, right?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.130
We'll be together for a few more weeks.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.420
Let's get closer.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:11.790
Siyeol, how much longer do you need?

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.760
I'm done.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.980
As for your wish, just tell me
when you've decided.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.230
In that case...

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.480
Could I trouble you to take a photo?

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.079
I-I want to show off to my friends
that I'm filming a show.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.000
You can take as many as you want.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.740
Shall we go look for the intern teacher?

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.700
Cut. Okay.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.720
Mr. Na, you look much better now.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.770
Thank you.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.630
Mr. Na, give us a moment
as we check this scene.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.390
Thank you.

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.600

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.870
I mean, I got to meet him in person,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.850
and on top of that, I got his number, too?

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.350
I want to contact him...

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.530
I want to hear his voice...

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.060

No. Come to your senses, Na Aejoon!

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.500
Are you going to call him
and say that you're a fan?

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.700
But...

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.250

other books during class,

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.190
Why do you think the school hired
someone like you

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.500
with no good educational background
or experience?

Well.

What about you?

00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:09.630
You even left me with your bank account.

Siyeol's phone number.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.460

to let all this fall apart.

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:16.550
Why are you asking about
first love stories during class time?

00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:19.480
You're making Mr. Choi uncomfortable.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.210
H-How could you ask that?

00:11:21.210 --> 00:11:22.940
Seriously.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.870
Would you mind sharing with us, Mr. Choi?

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.710
Oh, my first love?

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:37.310
I think it was when I was 18.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:43.950
That was when I was
the most anxious, nervous, and tired.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:49.210
There was a group of people
who'd give me one-sided support.

00:11:49.210 --> 00:11:51.000
It's our...

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.520
A Want You.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:59.060
Oh? I mean it.

00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.030
I like them the most.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:03.150
I love them now.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:06.130
-[Want Yous love you more, Siyeol.]
-Shall we start the class?

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.470
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:10.620
You can start the class from here.

00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:12.310
Okay.

00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.900
Mr. Choi will read you some materials.

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.980
Listen carefully.

00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.150
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:22.170
In a birch forest
filled with nameless flowers,

00:12:22.170 --> 00:12:25.120
I recalled a memory.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.600
The old woman who lived in the cabin said,

00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.650
"Even a single gust of wind,

00:12:29.650 --> 00:12:30.970
a blade of grass,

00:12:30.970 --> 00:12:32.950
or a drop of dew—

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:36.820
everything has a reason
for its existence."

00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.060
The grandmother
would often stop on the path.

00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:47.020
She would then
quietly stroke a still stone and say,

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:50.920
"This stone supports someone's path

00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.030
or helps rainwater flow."

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.190
Okay, that's all for today.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.960
Let's applaud for today's intern teacher.

00:13:00.390 --> 00:13:02.430
Don't forget to do your homework.

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:03.290
Remember to hand it in.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:04.560
-Yes!
-Yes!

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:07.350
Mr. Choi, come to our class next time too!

00:13:08.470 --> 00:13:09.970
Let's go.

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:12.960
-Good job.
-Siyeol.

00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.430
You did a really good job.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:15.910
Ah... Yes.

00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:17.800
Thank you.

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.530
Mr. Choi, can we take a photo together?

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:20.700
I'm sorry. We're busy.

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.870
Let's do it next time.

00:13:21.870 --> 00:13:24.760
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:26.760
Get back to studying.

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.550
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.860
The atmosphere is different.

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:33.700
Did something happen?

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:43.340
You said you wanted to try the cafeteria.

00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.220
How is it?

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:49.750
It's really good.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:52.370
Especially this. This is my favorite.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:53.770
I know.

00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:55.350
Eat more, our baby.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:56.950
When I was a kid,

00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.940
-my mum made this for me a lot...
-Hold on.

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.680
Let us change the memory card.

00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:14.050
Is this enough?

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.990
Take more off.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.040
Again?

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.640
That unfamiliar face.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:25.740
Have some.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.760
Okay, let's continue the filming.

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.110
Choi Siyeol, Mr. Na,
can we start filming now?

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.930
Okay, action.

00:14:38.110 --> 00:14:42.050
Do the teachers come and eat
at the cafeteria every day?

00:14:42.050 --> 00:14:43.550
Huh?

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.420
Yes, there are days like that,

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:49.310
and there are days where we eat out.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:51.330
But...

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:54.690
this sausage is the best.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.360
It's your first time experiencing
being an intern teacher.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.190
How do you feel?

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:02.940
To be honest, I was worried.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:06.510
But thanks to Mr. Na's gentle guidance,

00:15:06.510 --> 00:15:08.410
it was a really fun experience.

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.990
But you're so good that it
didn't look like it was your first time.

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.600
Really?

00:15:16.340 --> 00:15:19.310
He somehow feels... unfamiliar.

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.550
The first day of "Go! School Teacher"
has wrapped up successfully.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.870
I'll get off work for today.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.180
See you next time.

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.420
-Bye.
-Bye.

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:30.270
Cut. Okay.

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.400
Good work.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.350
Good work.

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:35.530
Good job.

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.050
Good work, Siyeol.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.960
Yes.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.780
Good work.

00:15:44.970 --> 00:15:47.200
Mr. Choi, this is for you.

00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:48.910
Mr. Choi, you're so handsome.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:50.720
Thank you.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.820
Mr. Na, hold on.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:54.620
Yes.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:58.270
Let me show you the schedule.

00:16:02.370 --> 00:16:04.310
We need to match the dates.

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:05.660
Yes.

00:16:13.060 --> 00:16:15.530
No matter what,
that was a gift from the students...

00:16:15.530 --> 00:16:17.390
Oh, right. The clothes!

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.840
Things that only happen in dreams
keep happening,

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.090
making me confused.

00:16:27.090 --> 00:16:29.180
We'll be together for a few more weeks.

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:31.530
Let's get closer.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.330
I got his number, worried all night,
and was so dramatic about it.

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:36.640
I want to contact him...

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:38.660
I want to hear his voice...

00:16:39.740 --> 00:16:41.990
How embarrassing, Na Aejoon.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.900
These are all things
you don't have to worry about.

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:46.450
Ah. Yes.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:47.760
Thank you.

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:49.470
Good work.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:58.210
I knew it.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.330
Fantasies should stay as fantasies.

00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.420
[Stabilizer]

00:17:23.119 --> 00:17:24.069
Good work, Siyeol.

00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:25.630
Mm.

00:17:25.630 --> 00:17:30.130
Brother, I need to talk to Ms. Han.

00:17:30.130 --> 00:17:32.740
I'm afraid it'll take a long time.

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:34.500
Get in the car first.

00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.920
-Got it.
-Okay.

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:41.810
[Na Aejoon]

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:53.650
Hello?

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:56.590
This is Na Aejoon.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.350
I know.

00:17:58.350 --> 00:18:00.010
Go ahead.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:03.130
I haven't returned the clothes I borrowed.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.650
Where are you now?

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.890
Your clothes.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.400
You could've returned it to me
during the next recording.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:28.350
Even so...

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.580
Also...

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:33.510
Here.

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.820
I saw this in your pocket.

00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:40.740
I was worried that by acting
I didn't see it might upset you.

00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:45.500
Ah...

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.200
Yes.

00:18:49.390 --> 00:18:52.910
Well. See you during the next recording!

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:56.590
Well...

00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:04.360
I thought about not saying this
since it could be

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.690
crossing the line.

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:11.140
But you seemed tired during the recording.

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:14.630
During times like that,
you could give me a signal.

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:20.180
What do you mean?

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:22.230
Well...

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:24.690
For example, the fact that you don't eat–

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.380
but maybe this is just how you always are.

00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:31.310
I saw there were times your face
turned gloomy during the recording...

00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:33.620
If I got it wrong,

00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:35.850
I'm really sorry.

00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:38.450
I said something wrong.

00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:40.420
Who are you to say that?

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.170
That's right.

00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:44.140
I have neurogenic gastritis.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:46.990
I'm not quite able to eat
during recordings.

00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:49.320
After drinking a spiked drink
three years ago,

00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.160
the company has set a rule
for me to avoid any outside food.

00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:55.080
-Oh, that's why...
-But...

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:58.350
My face turned gloomy
at times during the filming

00:19:59.370 --> 00:20:01.870
was not because of my physical condition.

00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:03.140
Huh?

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.450
Well, then it's because...

00:20:05.450 --> 00:20:07.860
It's because of

00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:09.500
Mr. Na Aejoon.

00:20:10.970 --> 00:20:12.820
Huh?

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:19.990
Did I do something wrong...

00:20:21.210 --> 00:20:25.900
We exchanged numbers and I even
took the initiative to text you.

00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:28.340
Yet you didn't reply.

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:29.980
Are you

00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.660
drawing a line with me?

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:35.580
Me?

00:20:37.550 --> 00:20:37.950
[Choi Siyeol: Please take care of me
for today's recording too.]

00:20:37.950 --> 00:20:41.120
Please take care of me
for today's recording too.

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.260
How could I ignore my bias's text...

00:20:46.310 --> 00:20:48.530
I didn't mean to ignore it.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.140
I might have seen it while I was working
and forgot to reply...

00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:52.050
Really!

00:20:52.050 --> 00:20:54.600
How could I not reply to your messages...

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:55.740
So...

00:20:55.740 --> 00:21:00.240
It didn't go as I thought,
so I felt really upset and stiffled.

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.530
I couldn't even look at your face all day.

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:06.570
I mean...

00:21:06.570 --> 00:21:10.450
Why would someone like you
b-be upset because of

00:21:10.450 --> 00:21:11.980
someone like me?

00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:13.840
This is really...

00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:15.480
How should I put it?

00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:17.590
I-I don't understand.

00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:20.260
I'm already making it so clear.

00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:22.660
Do you still not understand?

00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.160
You don't seem to hate it though...

00:21:39.050 --> 00:21:43.160
I'm flirting...

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.410
with you, Mr. Na Aejoon.

00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.220
Since the first time I met you,

00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.330
I've been interested

00:21:57.330 --> 00:21:59.410
in you.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:10.980
[In the next episode]

00:22:10.980 --> 00:22:12.980
Kyusung wants to break up.

00:22:12.980 --> 00:22:16.200
I don't know what to do.

00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:18.890
You can't do this to Jooha.

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:21.030
We can't do this to Jooha.

00:22:21.030 --> 00:22:23.830
I think he's seeing someone else.

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:26.550
Do you want to meet today?

00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:28.270
I'm very interested

00:22:28.270 --> 00:22:31.030
in you.

00:22:31.030 --> 00:22:35.640
Are you... seeing someone?
