I'm flirting with you.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.160
Since the first time I met you,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.880
I've been interested

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.780
in you–

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.600
Mr. Na Aejoon.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.990
I'm not rushing you to give me an answer.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.520
There's still a long time
before the recording wraps up.

But...

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.800
if I text you, please reply me.

Mr. Na Aejoon?

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.789
I-I-I'm here to return
the clothes I borrowed.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.509
[6 months ago]

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.110
Ji Kyusung!

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:55.700
Have you eaten?

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.060
Yeah.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.300
Why didn't you come here?

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.550
I told you to rest.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.540
I missed you.

Oh.

You're done already?

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.009
Yeah.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.190
Jooha said he came to cheer for me,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.060
but seems like
there's someone else he wants to see.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.440
N-No...

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.140
I'm here to cheer for your performance.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.090
Tsk.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.750
Give me a minute
before you go for the interview.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.520
Wait for me.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.680
It looks nice here.

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.790
Don't you think he looks great in glasses?

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.460
Seriously.

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.000
What about it?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.860
You've been dating for so long.
You still like him so much?

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.980
Yes, I like him a lot.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.930
As long as

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.480
you're happy.

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.040

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.130
Yeah?

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.740
Don't say embarrassing things like that.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.530
Okay.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.700
I love you too.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.220

Hey, Na Aejoon.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:40.490
Stop drinking until I get there.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.480
Got it.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.860
I'll be right there.

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.760
Hello? Jooha?

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.970
Kyu Sung wants to break up.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.910
I don't know what to do...

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.180
I...

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.440

Na Aejoon.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.769
Why do you always leave things behind?

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.190
Don't forget this.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.680
How can I live without you?

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.500
I'm off.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.740
Okay.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.260
Oh right.

You remember you're in charge
of dinner tonight, right?

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:27.670
Of course.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.420
Just look forward to it.

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.200
You called me?

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.400
Is this about Jooha?

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.520
You can't do this to Jooha.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:59.220
We...

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.530
We can't do this to Jooha.

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.160
I want Mr. Na Aejoon to guide me.

Me? You want me?

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:29.140
Mr. Na Aejoon, you're my type.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.140
[Jooha.]

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.940
[I'll let you experience]

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.380
[the same feeling of betrayal.]

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.520
[I'll make you feel]

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.580
[more pain.]

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.940
Mr. Ji.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.260
Yes?

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.650
Yeon Jooha.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.580
You heard that he's not
picking up that movie, right?

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:00.700
Yes.

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.010
This is driving me crazy.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.970
What should I do with them?

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.690
Did he say why

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.480
he's not picking it up?

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.690
If I knew,
I would have done something already.

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.500
Anyway, I got it.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:17.020
S-Sir.

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:21.200
Shall I try contacting him again?

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.110
Jooha.

00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:55.680
What is it?

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:58.240
Well...

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.930
[Because I haven't seen you for a while...]

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:04.680
[Not that...]

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.740
Well...
[I'm worried about you...]

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.400
[That's worse...]

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.630
This is about Director Baek's movie.

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.700
I heard you told the CEO
that you're not picking it up.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:21.750
Yeah.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.270
It's Jin Seoyoon
who'll be acting with you.

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:26.150
-Your next film is very important to you–
-Did you

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.040
come all the way here to tell me this?

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.320
Yeah.

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:39.130
I'm not doing it.

00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:40.900
Tell the CEO that too.

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:43.500
Even if Director Baek
comes to persuade me personally,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:46.980
I won't change my answer.

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.140
Why did you change your mind now?

00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:51.770
You attended the meeting
because you wanted to do it, didn’t you?

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:53.620
I did.

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.970
Back then, you,
Ji Kyusung, were still by my side.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.420
If we wanted to meet all the time
while avoiding the public,

00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:03.160
I had to work more frequently.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.410
But I don't need to do that anymore.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.110
I want to rest.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:14.390
When this drama ends.

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.220
So,

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.630
just tell the CEO that too.

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:28.600
Jooha.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.900
I still can't help liking you.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.110
So I hope you don't
show up in front of me.

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.710
You should at least be considerate
about that.

00:08:44.169 --> 00:08:46.010
I'm leaving.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:58.390
A golden field in autumn,

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:01.340
dancing in the wind.

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:03.350
I will not lose my greenness,

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.950
not even in the winter snow.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.200
I will not lose my greenness...

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.690
I will not lose my greenness...

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:18.120
I will not lose my greenness,

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:21.900
not even in... the winter snow.

00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:23.910
Hey, what's with Mr. Na?

00:09:23.910 --> 00:09:25.450
I guess this is coming out in the exam.

00:09:25.450 --> 00:09:28.010
Jot it down.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.880
The winter snow...

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.480
Since the first time I met you,

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.970
I've been interested

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:08.740
in you.

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.900
[This fantasy-like situation
that no one would believe.]

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:18.110
[It's a situation that could
disappear anytime, just like mist.]

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.040
But just for a moment,

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.380
I wanted to put aside my worries

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.400
about reality and the future.

00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:32.960
It has your scent now,
so I can't return it to the sponsor.

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:36.710
[It has your scent now,
so I can't return it to the sponsor.]

00:10:36.710 --> 00:10:36.790
Oh no.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.980
[Oh no. I shouldn't have borrowed it...]

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.730
I shouldn't have borrowed it...

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:42.280
That's a good thing.

00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:43.200
I'm going to keep this.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:47.020
[That's a good thing.
I'm going to keep this.]

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.190
This unbelievable happiness.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:52.040
This is crazy.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:55.110
I'm texting my bias one-on-one...

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:56.550
That's ridiculous.

00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:58.860
He's the one who sent
the first text too!

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:07.680
What if he

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.640
finds out that I'm a fan

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:12.460
in the future?

00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.890
What's going on?

00:11:23.890 --> 00:11:25.040
Why are you back so early?

00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.400
Yeah...

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.320
Great.

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:31.930
I have something to discuss with you.

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:35.540
I have a serious dilemma.

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.320
Never mind.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.230
Go sleep.

00:11:48.230 --> 00:11:51.430
I'll talk to you after I figure it out.

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:53.520
Go ahead.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.260
Get some rest.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:09.090
I'm sure it'll be okay
to put it off for a while, right?

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.230
He blue‑ticked me...

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.660
Well,

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.020
I met Kyusung.

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:33.150
I think he's seeing someone else.

00:12:37.950 --> 00:12:40.190
Are you okay?

00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:42.010
I thought it'd be a lot easier
for me to give up

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:45.200
after hearing him say that himself.

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.990
But I regret it.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:53.820
Those words kept pricking my heart.

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.680
The more I think about it,
the worse it feels.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.180
What should I do?

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:13.230
I think this will take a while.

00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:20.340
I won't,

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.420
Jooha.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.990
I will never

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.190
let you go.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.230
I promise you.

00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:39.290
Thanks.

00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:54.680
Should I give you the dry‑cleaning fee?

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.760
[Mr. Na Aejoon:
Should I give you the dry‑cleaning fee?]

00:13:56.760 --> 00:13:57.490
Can I have your account number?

00:13:57.490 --> 00:13:59.060
[Mr. Na Aejoon:
Can I have your account number?]

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:02.950
Dry‑cleaning fee?

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:08.380
Forget the dry‑cleaning fee.
Buy me a meal.

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:13.460
[Forget the dry‑cleaning fee.
Buy me a meal.]

00:14:13.460 --> 00:14:13.480
Do you want to meet today?

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:17.080
[Do you want to meet today?]

00:14:33.050 --> 00:14:34.880
Do you have a reservation?

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:37.350
Well...

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:39.170
Sir?

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:40.110
Ah, yes.

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:41.970
Well...

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.670
Name...

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:44.470
I have a reservation.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.160
Under Choi Siyeol.

00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.130
This way, please.

00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.650
Let's go.

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:21.030
I never thought I could ever see Siyeol
in his personal clothes with my own eyes.

00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:24.160
This may be a bit rude
to the sacred Siyeol,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.540
but I really want to...

00:15:26.410 --> 00:15:29.670
touch his neck just once.

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:31.700
What do you want to eat?

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:34.170
Neck... What am I saying?

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.080
I-I...

00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:40.180
I want pork neck.

00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:47.990
Excuse me.

00:15:53.990 --> 00:15:55.580
Please give me this and this.

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:57.340
A bottle of this, too.

00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.080
Yes, sir.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:07.420
Since I chose the restaurant
and the dishes,

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.910
it's on me today.

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:10.720
As for Mr. Na,

00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.570
you can treat me next time.

00:16:11.570 --> 00:16:12.840
No, I can't...

00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:14.680
This is the only way I can make sure

00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:17.380
we meet again next time.

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.710
How do you like the food?

00:16:43.710 --> 00:16:46.100
I like it.

00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:47.450
I always eat at the school cafeteria.

00:16:47.450 --> 00:16:50.750
It's thanks to you I got to eat
at such a nice restaurant.

00:16:50.750 --> 00:16:52.740
I'll make you something better next time.

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:54.140
Come hang out at my place.

00:16:59.390 --> 00:17:01.060
What?

00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:05.250
Well... I'm pretty good at cooking.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:09.890
Oh, so you're good at cooking.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:12.750
You must be busy with work.
How did you have time to learn to cook?

00:17:12.750 --> 00:17:14.349
There's nothing you can't do–I mean–

00:17:14.349 --> 00:17:15.750
well...

00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:18.300
When is your next recording?

00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.010
After your album promotions
and variety show filming,

00:17:21.010 --> 00:17:23.030
you must be tired.

00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:33.770
It's fun.

00:17:33.770 --> 00:17:36.200
After all,
I can see the person I want to see

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:39.630
in the guise of recording.

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:41.600
What?

00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.750
Is he talking about me?

00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:44.390
Is he really flirting with me?

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:46.120
Am I not making hallucinating?

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:48.760
So,

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.890
are you considering what I told you?

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.660
I'm very interested

00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:58.930
in you.

00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:04.420
If you already have

00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.450
a partner...

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.370
Well... I don't...

00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:14.460
have a partner.

00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.470
That's good.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.490
Without picking up the glass–

00:18:59.470 --> 00:19:01.420
just like this.

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.360
Okay.

00:20:33.810 --> 00:20:39.150
[In the next episode]

00:20:39.690 --> 00:20:41.930
I can't even tell
if it's a dream or reality.

00:20:41.930 --> 00:20:43.920
How dare I kiss Siyeol?

00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:45.150
What?

00:20:45.150 --> 00:20:46.080
A hickey?

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.460
As you get older,
you become more worthless.

00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:49.030
Yet you're still acting all arrogant.

00:20:49.030 --> 00:20:50.460
Hey, everyone can hear you.

00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.630
If you have other clothes aside,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:54.160
I guess this is all you have today.

00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.160
I have a reason for dressing like this...

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.260
Shall we take this chance
to go for a couple look?

00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.680
Are you

00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:02.730
interested in me too now?
