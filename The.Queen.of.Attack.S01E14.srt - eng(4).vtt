WEBVTT

00:00:06.016 --> 00:00:10.400
=The Queen of Attack=

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.324
=Episode 14=

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.120
Oh, no.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.080
W-What's wrong?

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.760
Since the County Princess has spoken,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.120
she must not go back on her word,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.920
or her honor will be damaged.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.920
It's too late
to cancel the engagement now.

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.240
Angering her will cost you your life.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.560
The most urgent matter now

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.160
is to stop Qing
from escalating the situation.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.720
If she learns

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.600
that Lady Qing covets Prince Xian,

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.320
there may be no way to salvage this.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.840
- Well...
- Well...

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.040
In that case,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.320
the best strategy is to retreat.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.120
I'll find a solution
for the remaining issues later.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.160
Okay, let's go. Hurry.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:52.240
Let's go.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.720
That day you declared before everyone

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.280
your intention to marry her.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.040
Now rumors are spreading.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.480
The royal family does not jest.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.760
It's difficult
to fabricate excuses anymore.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120
How do you plan to handle this?

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.760
My resolve to marry Lady Xu

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.880
has never wavered.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.880
Is that so?

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.920
I just want to tell you

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.560
that if you insist on marrying her,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.720
I shall enter the palace
and report to His Majesty

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.760
about Hong Linlang's pregnancy.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.360
Thus,

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.960
you'll forfeit the title,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
and your marriage

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.280
won't affect the mansion's reputation.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.800
Both I and the royal family

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.840
will not interfere

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.800
whom you marry.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.880
- I...
- I merely asked you to consider,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.880
not to declare it immediately.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.480
Some words, once spoken,

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.800
leave no room for regret.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.400
Xu Ziyi!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.160
I will kill you!

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.600
Your Highness.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.920
Your Highness,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.520
I won't marry that dying man.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.000
I want to marry Prince Xian.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.920
What did you say?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:07.600
It's her.

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.480
You shameless woman! You deceived me!

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:10.560
Enough!

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:11.600
Come home with me.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.120
No!

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:13.440
Father,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:14.640
I can't accept it.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.720
Why can't I marry Prince Xian

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.920
and be the Princess Consort?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.280
Xu Ziyi just looks like Lin...

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.960
Silence!

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.920
Do you want to doom all of us?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.240
Let's go.

00:02:26.624 --> 00:02:27.200
Father!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.800
Go.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.880
Madwoman.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.960
The whole family's mad.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.320
- Let's go. Hurry.
- Father,

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.480
I won't go!

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.880
Go.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.520
Go.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.400
Go!

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.796
(Prince Rui's Mansion)

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.600
It's time to eliminate them completely.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.840
No!

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.880
Forget about Prince Xian.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.320
Get inside now.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.480
Honestly!

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.080
Her stubborn temper

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.280
comes from you.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.600
How is it my fault?

00:03:43.827 --> 00:03:45.952
(In Memory of
the Late Father and Mother)

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.720
Father.

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.600
You couldn't control your own marriage,

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.000
thus clashing with your parents.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.640
And your resentment toward them

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.600
grew heavier.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.760
Lin Hong'er couldn't
control her marriage,

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:35.160
thus clashing with her parents.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.320
And her resentment grew heavier.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.440
You grasped a knife.

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.720
And she grasped a knife,

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:50.240
stabbing repeatedly

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.560
until her parents perished.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.640
Stabbing repeatedly

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.400
until your parents perished.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.360
What is it?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.880
Why the panic?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.680
The Prefect sent word

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.080
about a case involving the mansion.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.520
He requested you send a representative

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.480
to testify.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.400
You may leave.

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.080
How did us get involved in a case?

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.360
I'll go.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.720
Don't worry.

00:06:49.139 --> 00:06:51.000
(Constable)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.720
Who's there?

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:59.760
Master Shentu.

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.160
Where's the Perfect?

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.920
He is occupied with duties.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:03.880
Please take a rest.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:08.920
The Perfect instructed me to...

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:14.280
I'll see to it now.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.240
Come out.

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.600
Even the Prefecture officials know you?

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.840
I'm genuinely curious about your past.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.680
Don't be curious.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.000
Follow me.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.040
My lord,

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.080
the suspect is awake.

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.280
Bring her in.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:38.880
Understood.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.320
The trial will be held outside.

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:50.720
Just a wall apart.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:55.904
My lord.

00:07:56.736 --> 00:07:57.240
My lord,

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.080
I'm innocent.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:00.120
I didn't kill my parents.

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.240
Did you...

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.440
My lord, please hear me out.

00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.440
I'm afraid

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.800
if I don't speak now,

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.320
I might lose my chance to speak forever.

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.920
They've used this tactic before.

00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:13.160
They killed my parents,

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.120
and then framed me for it,

00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:18.480
just like they framed Lin Hong'er
back then.

00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.840
My lord.

00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:20.480
Hong'er?

00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.240
I'm sorry, Hong'er.

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.600
What are you talking about?

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.120
The Hong'er you just said
is Hong Linlang?

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.200
Your Highness.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:40.600
Hong Linlang?

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:42.440
What Hong Linlang?

00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.040
Then who's Hong'er?

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.280
What happened to her?

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.280
Hong'er...

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.880
Hong'er is dead.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.320
It was a capital crime.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:53.960
But I know

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.920
she didn't kill her parents.

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.560
She was innocent.

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.280
It was the Lai County case?

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:05.880
Lai County again...

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.800
The girl convicted
of killing her parents

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.600
was innocent?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.160
I'm innocent too.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.720
I didn't kill my parents, either.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:16.800
You know the truth
about that case, right?

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:18.640
What's your connection to that girl?

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.800
Did you forget?

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:22.400
She was my cousin

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.640
and the lover you've been
desperately searching for.

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:27.280
Then what about Xu Ziyi?

00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.920
Prince Xian, calm down.

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.080
Stay calm.

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.120
Explain this to me!

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.400
She's obviously fake.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.112
Don't be afraid.

00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.880
It'll be over soon.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:56.760
Explain yourself.

00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.280
Explain yourself!

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.800
Xu Ziyi...

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.680
Sh-She...

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.400
Uncle.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.160
Uncle.

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.040
Uncle.

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:08.880
Uncle, I was wrong.

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:10.840
- Have mercy, please.
- Your Highness,

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:13.000
- she's clearly gone mad.
- Uncle!

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.160
Feed that bird's nest

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:17.640
to me.

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.800
What exactly did Xu Ziyi do?

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.800
Explain.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.520
Explain yourself!

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:26.800
Xu Ziyi?

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:28.480
Who's Xu Ziyi?

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.160
I don't know Xu Ziyi.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.280
I don't know...

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:32.720
I don't know her.

00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.760
Your Highness, she's clearly insane.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.400
Nothing but delusional rambling.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.560
Uncle, it wasn't me.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.640
Not my doing.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.624
Uncle.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.320
Uncle.

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.120
- Take her away.
- Uncle.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.800
Understood.

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.400
How could this happen?

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.280
How did she suddenly lose her mind?

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:58.640
Stay calm.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:00.480
Or everything will be in vain.

00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.160
She mustn't lose her mind.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:03.800
She mustn't lose her mind!

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.520
My lord,

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:07.720
walls have ears.

00:11:13.236 --> 00:11:19.572
♪Fate begins and ends, I sip the past♪

00:11:19.572 --> 00:11:25.233
♪Love and hatred flow endlessly♪

00:11:26.164 --> 00:11:33.780
♪When spring comes, I see the truth♪

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:39.879
♪We've changed through the years♪

00:11:39.879 --> 00:11:46.548
♪Cold lamps reflect pear blossom dew♪

00:11:46.548 --> 00:11:54.228
♪Worlds change as streams run west♪

00:11:54.228 --> 00:12:01.254
♪Rains veil hills, gathering sorrows♪

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:07.412
♪In deep courtyards, hands drift apart♪
