00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.840
My dad, my family...

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.040
I don't need them anymore.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.180
Shinichiro.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.220
Have it your way.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.720
I'm sorry.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.530
It's my fault for kissing you.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.520
I won't just kiss people when I'm drunk anymore.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:55.580
It's not your fault, Kosuke.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:00.280
But...

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.810
You see now, don't you?

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.560
What kind of person my dad is.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.070
It doesn't matter anymore.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.710
I already said I'm not going home.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.040
Go home.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.860
Huh?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.310
Talking about abandoning everything...

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:31.780
Don't just say things on a whim.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.160
Even if you want to be with your family,

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.150
you'll lose them one day anyway.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.590
Just try a little harder.

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.190
If it still doesn't work out,

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.460
we'll go back to our place together.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:11.580
Okay.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.180
I still have my luggage.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.710
So I'm heading back today.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.260
Will you be okay by yourself?

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.830
Do you want me to go with you?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.820
I'm fine.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.150
I'll go back by myself.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.890
It'll probably be less of a mess if I go alone.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.220
That's true.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.300
Call me if anything happens.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:49.620
I'll be there right away.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.750
Thank you.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.410
I'm not alone.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.230
I have Kosuke with me.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.900
Stay By My Side After the Rain

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.200
(Episode 11)

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.550
I'm home.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:09.890
Welcome back.

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.100
Did you have fun at your reunion?

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.910
Where's Dad?

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.450
He came home, went to his room, and hasn't come out.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.000
Did something happen
at the neighborhood association meeting?

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.790
Shinichiro?

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.900
Mom, Yui.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:55.690
There's something I need to tell you.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.730
What is it?

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.070
You're kind of scaring me.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.600
The truth is...

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.030
The person I like...

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.110
is a guy.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.680
Huh?

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:39.780
So...

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.600
I'm... gay.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:52.740
What?

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.320
W-wait a minute...

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.620
I see.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:07.280
I see.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.720
I'm sorry if this is a shock.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:14.520
No, not at all.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.540
Maybe...

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.130
you might find me disgusting.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.000
Thank you for telling us.

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:32.550
Huh?

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.850
I'm so glad you felt you could tell us, Shinichiro.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:38.540
Yeah...

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:40.520
Yeah.

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.490
What made you decide to tell us now?

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:48.380
It's because...

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.680
Dad...

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.740
he found out.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.430
Dad found out?

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.420
Yeah.

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:02.520
Because Dad's the way he is,

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:04.640
he might...

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:06.920
disown me or something.

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.990
But Mom, Yui...

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.430
Did you try to have a proper talk with Dad?

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.380
N-no...

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:23.770
Not really a proper talk.

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.800
You know how Dad is.

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:29.540
He'd just get angry even if I tried talking to him.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:32.390
That's not true.

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.210
It was the same when Yui said she wanted to go
to fashion design school.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.150
Dad was against it too,

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:41.360
but after hearing Yui out...

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.840
he went and checked out a bunch of schools all by himself.

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.400
Really?

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:49.270
In his own way, your dad

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:53.730
is really trying to understand you.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.020
So,

00:07:55.590 --> 00:07:57.560
why don't you try explaining things to him, Shinichiro?

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.000
But...

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:06.020
I'm on your side, Shinichiro.

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.470
I'm on your side too.

00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:15.810
No matter who you love,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:18.430
you'll always be my big brother.

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:23.900
Thank you.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:29.190
Anyway, it's late. Go take a bath.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:30.660
I'll get a towel out for you.

00:08:31.050 --> 00:08:31.860
Okay.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.730
Mom, how can you be so calm?

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.110
I had a feeling.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:50.230
I've suspected it for a while.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.480
Wait, you knew all along?

00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:53.600
More or less. I had a hunch.

00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:56.640
Then you should've told him!

00:08:58.230 --> 00:09:01.510
How could I say anything?
Shinichiro never said a word about it himself.

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.630
But... he...

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.110
...the fact that he likes men.

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:07.830
He's been hiding it from everyone, right?

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:10.120
He couldn't even tell his own family.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.980
That must have been so hard for him.

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.700
Yeah...

00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:27.600
Ah...

00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.620
It's out in the open now...

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.240
Come in.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.410
Shinichiro, let's all sleep in here.

00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:39.310
Huh?

00:09:39.690 --> 00:09:42.900
We used to do this all the time
when we were kids, remember?

00:09:43.290 --> 00:09:44.640
It'll be fun, just for a night.

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:46.630
No, but it'll be too cramped.

00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:49.890
- It's not cramped at all.
- Yeah, there's plenty of room.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:53.760
Here, a pillow.

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.890
Oh, wait. I'll just squeeze in over there.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.210
Shinichiro, are you turning in too?

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:01.610
Yeah.

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:04.660
Okay, lights out.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:11.980
- Good night.
- Good night.

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.520
Can I say something?

00:10:14.700 --> 00:10:16.440
Sure.

00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:20.280
Hey.

00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.170
Can I come visit you in Tokyo sometime?

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.610
I want to go too!

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.000
I want to go shopping in Yaesu and Ginza.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.730
Me too!

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:33.370
Okay, how about we all go
after Shinichiro gets his bonus?

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:34.270
Yeah!

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:37.020
Hey, don't make plans without me.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:38.340
Let me know, okay?

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.310
Where should we go?

00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:47.960
Into my world,

00:10:48.330 --> 00:10:49.800
more people have come.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:09.640
Kosuke.

00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.480
Hmm?

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.240
Is now a good time to talk?

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:15.450
Yeah.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:16.750
What is it?

00:11:30.810 --> 00:11:33.470
All the money you've sent me until now...

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:35.480
...it's all here.

00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.600
But this was for you, Grandma...

00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800
I know.

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:50.180
You wanted me to use it to take care of your mother.

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.120
That's why you sent money every month, isn't it?

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:54.950
I've been saving all of it.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:58.530
I was planning to give it to your mother one day.

00:11:58.830 --> 00:12:00.700
Then why?

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.290
I talked to that girl who's so keen on being independent.

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.490
I told her about this money.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:06.770
And she told me,

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.790
Give this back to Kosuke.

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:11.980
What?

00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.650
From now on, I'll contribute to the household too.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.050
And we have Daisuke's survivor benefits.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.520
I don't want to be a burden to Kosuke.

00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:35.080
I want to be a proper mother to him.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:40.960
This is what your mother wants.

00:12:41.400 --> 00:12:42.460
So please, take it.

00:12:45.370 --> 00:12:46.420
But, Grandma...

00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.380
Don't worry about me.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.870
I don't have to pay rent for this house.

00:12:51.290 --> 00:12:53.060
And I have my own pension.

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:55.900
Plus, your mother said she'll contribute.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.270
So that money...

00:12:59.090 --> 00:13:01.570
...you should use it however you want.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:03.700
That way,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.480
your mother will be happier too.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.430
If you ever need anything, you have to let me know.

00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:12.650
Alright, alright.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.510
I'll be counting on you then.

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:18.320
I'm going to bed.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.220
Good night.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.030
Good night.

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:43.760
Shinichiro, what time is your train?

00:13:44.450 --> 00:13:45.230
Four o'clock.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:47.580
Want to go shopping for a bit before you leave?

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.390
Sure.

00:13:53.640 --> 00:13:54.560
Where are you going?

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:55.650
Just for a walk.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.330
What are you doing?

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:42.230
Don't follow me.

00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:45.440
Um...

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.760
Dad...

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:52.520
Am I still welcome here?

00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.450
I...

00:14:56.630 --> 00:14:59.060
...couldn't become the person you wanted me to be.

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.530
I don't expect you to understand me.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:04.690
But...

00:15:05.330 --> 00:15:06.150
I...

00:15:09.590 --> 00:15:12.240
What do you take me for?

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:16.710
I'm not as clueless as you think.

00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.620
After what happened yesterday, I did some research.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.580
I was trying to understand what kind of person you are,

00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:26.590
in my own way.

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:33.650
So you looked me up and now you get it?

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.040
You think you understand me now?

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:41.350
It's not like I became some alien you don't know.

00:15:41.420 --> 00:15:43.040
I've always been me.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:47.490
So, shouldn't you and Mom
be the ones who know me best?

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:49.510
Stop twisting my words.

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:53.940
You're just confusing me even more.

00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:56.650
Just leave me alone for a bit.

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:02.690
Can't you just try a little harder?

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.060
Wait.

00:16:11.450 --> 00:16:14.180
- We're not done talking.
- I'm tired.

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.260
Dad, why are you always like this?

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:18.430
You don't have to talk to me like that.

00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.150
Try to think about how I feel for once.

00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:27.110
I've always...

00:16:30.020 --> 00:16:30.830
All this time...

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.980
When you were little, you slipped right here

00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:38.830
and almost fell into the river.

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:41.270
Huh?

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:43.800
I tried to save you,

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:45.770
and ended up slipping myself.

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:47.330
Ahh!!!

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.320
Dad was soaking wet.

00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:55.510
I was panicking,

00:16:56.340 --> 00:16:58.770
but you were just laughing your head off.

00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:00.880
Dad, here.

00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.720
Oh.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.480
Thank you.

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:09.470
Your hand back then,

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.140
it was so small.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:19.130
Why...

00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:20.590
Why are you telling me this?

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.550
Every time I held that little hand of yours, I'd...

00:17:25.490 --> 00:17:28.300
I'd think about how I had to protect you from now on.

00:17:30.070 --> 00:17:31.200
It made me feel so proud.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.430
And so happy.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.340
It made me feel like I'd finally
become a man in my own right.

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:44.290
I just assumed you'd naturally
become that kind of man too.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.870
That's why I wanted you to become
a responsible man.

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.370
But...

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:56.490
you and I are different after all.

00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:02.700
I keep wondering what all those things
I taught you were for.

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.200
It just makes me feel helpless.

00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.440
I'm just a stubborn old man.

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:15.400
I'm sorry.

00:18:19.530 --> 00:18:20.580
For all the time being,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.140
it was always painful for me,
not being able to live up to your expectations.

00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.510
Why?

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:31.350
I finally understand now.

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:35.600
- Look at you, you're all wet.
- So are you, Dad.

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:36.540
Whoa.

00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:38.950
Mom's going to be so mad.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:41.290
Okay, let's stop by the bathhouse on our way home.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.360
Yeah! Let's go!

00:18:42.420 --> 00:18:43.560
Okay.

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:44.800
This will be our little secret from Mom.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:47.110
Because I love you, Dad.

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:49.900
Okay.

00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.720
I'll come back.

00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:06.020
I'll definitely be back.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:10.860
You don't have to say that.

00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:13.950
This is your home.

00:19:24.010 --> 00:19:26.220
The thing I was so afraid of...

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:28.450
...turned out to be just this.

00:19:36.660 --> 00:19:38.460
It's okay if I disappoint him.

00:19:40.410 --> 00:19:42.360
It doesn't matter if I don't change.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200
It's okay.

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:50.500
I can take my time.

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:05.210
Still got 30 minutes.

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:06.820
Looks like we're a little early.

00:20:06.910 --> 00:20:08.560
I bought this. Want some?

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:11.840
Yes, please!

00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:13.610
Awesome!

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:14.720
Here.

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:15.780
Thanks.

00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:24.620
Pudding is always the best.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.190
Is your dad really going to be okay?

00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.890
Yeah...

00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.260
It'll work out somehow.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.590
That's good.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.930
I also told them
that I'm living with you, Kosuke.

00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:48.520
Oh, you did?

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.040
This trip home was so rushed.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:56.430
Yeah.

00:20:58.300 --> 00:20:59.710
But it was fun.

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:01.770
Really?

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:02.770
Yeah.

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:04.460
What about you, Kosuke?

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.970
I'm always happy.

00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.920
Coming back here...

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.490
reminds me of the times
I used to play with Shinichiro.

00:21:19.690 --> 00:21:22.050
I'm so glad we grew up.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:24.660
Huh?

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.030
It reminds me of a lot of things too.

00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:32.060
Like how I fell for you, Kosuke.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.200
And how I was too scared to do anything about it.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:38.860
Then I went to Tokyo...

00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:40.730
...and left everything behind.

00:21:41.810 --> 00:21:43.500
I found someone I like again,

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:47.100
but no matter how many times I try, things never go well.

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.730
I can never be the person I want to be.

00:21:54.770 --> 00:21:56.620
I just don't know what to do.

00:21:59.350 --> 00:22:00.520
All this time,

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:03.570
I've really hated myself.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:09.080
No matter how many times I start over,

00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.620
I'm still just me in the end.

00:22:15.490 --> 00:22:16.750
I can't change.

00:22:21.810 --> 00:22:22.830
But now...

00:22:23.710 --> 00:22:25.650
Kosuke is by my side.

00:22:27.770 --> 00:22:29.310
As long as Kosuke is here,

00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.430
I can actually like myself.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:36.900
Shinichiro.

00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.000
Seriously, what are you doing?

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.020
I was saving that for last!

00:23:04.710 --> 00:23:05.960
You're so childish.

00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.870
Whatever.

00:23:13.150 --> 00:23:14.300
Let's clean up.

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.890
Yeah.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:17.310
Ten years from now,

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:19.210
or twenty,

00:23:20.070 --> 00:23:23.990
I hope I can still be laughing happily
with Kosuke like this.

00:23:31.430 --> 00:23:32.510
I have tissues too.

00:24:45.630 --> 00:24:49.830
(Next Episode) The happier I am, the more I worry
about how long a life like this can last.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.160
(Will This Happiness Last Forever?)
We can't get married, after all.

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.000
Shinichiro's anxiety.

00:24:54.030 --> 00:24:55.340
If you're with me,

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:56.880
(The Future They Choose)
I'm sure we can cut it in half.

00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:58.120
So let's...

00:24:58.190 --> 00:24:59.590
be together forever.
